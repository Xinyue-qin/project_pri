# Prompt and result for the action generation (put-down) for the BLOCKS domain
Task Signature = [input: NL instruction, PDDL domain predicates; output: PDDL action]

**Prompt**:
Given a description of an action in some domain, convert it to Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) action. You may only use the allowed predicates for each action. 
Allowed Predicates: - (handempty) : the hand is empty. - (holding ?x - block): block x is held. - (clear ?x - block): block x is clear. - (on ?x - block ?y - block) : block x is on block y. - (ontable ?x - block): block x is on the table. 
Input: The action, “put-down” will have the hand put down a block. 
PDDL Action:

Sure! Here's how you can define the "put-down" action in PDDL using the 
allowed predicates:

```pddl
(:action put-down
    :parameters (?x - block)
    :precondition (holding ?x)
    :effect (and
              (not (holding ?x))
              (handempty)
              (ontable ?x)
            )
)
```

Explanation:
- Parameters: The action takes one parameter, `?x`, which represents a 
block.
- Precondition: The hand must be holding the block (`(holding ?x)`).
- Effect: After performing the action, the block is no longer being held 
by the hand (`(not (holding ?x))`), the hand becomes empty 
(`(handempty)`), and the block is now on the table (`(ontable ?x)`).
