# Action Similarity Analysis - Delivery Domain

## Critical Issue: Invalid LLM-Generated Action Structure
The LLM-generated "pick-up" action **does not follow PDDL syntax** and cannot be meaningfully compared to the gold standard using the similarity formula. Key problems include:

1. Uses non-PDDL keywords (`extend forall`, `when/then/else`)
2. Lacks proper parameter definitions
3. Contains undefined predicates (`has-package`, `at-location`)
4. Missing clear preconditions/effects structure

## Similarity Assessment
Due to the fundamental syntax mismatch, we cannot calculate a numerical similarity score. Instead, we provide a qualitative analysis:

### Gold Standard `pick-up` Action
```pddl
(:action pick-up
  :parameters (?a - agent ?p - package ?l - location)
  :precondition (and (at ?a ?l) (in ?p ?l) (available ?a))
  :effect (and (has ?a ?p) (not (in ?p ?l)))


Hypothetical "Best Case" Score:
Even if we ignore syntax and compare only conceptual similarities:

Preconditions: 0% match (LLM uses undefined predicates like has-package).

Effects: 0% match (LLM lacks clear effects).

Similarity: 1 - (3 + 2)/(3 + 2) = 0 (complete dissimilarity).
