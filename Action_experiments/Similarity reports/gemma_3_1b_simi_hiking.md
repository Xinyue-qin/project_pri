# Action Similarity Analysis - Hiking Domain

## Critical Syntax Error Analysis
The LLM-generated output is **not valid PDDL** and cannot be meaningfully compared to the gold standard. Key issues:

1. **Structural Violations**:
   - Missing `:requirements`, `:types`, and `:predicates` declarations
   - Uses non-PDDL constructs (`begin`, nested `define` blocks)
   - Action definitions don't follow `:action` syntax

2. **Semantic Breakdown**:
   - Predicates like `(action walk)` are meaningless in PDDL
   - Effects are completely missing (only invalid preconditions shown)
   - Parameter lists are undefined

3. **Gold Standard Comparison**:
   ```pddl
   (:action walk
     :parameters (?h - hiker ?from ?to - location)
     :precondition (and (at ?h ?from) (path-clear ?from ?to) (not (rained ?to)))
     :effect (and (not (at ?h ?from)) (at ?h ?to))
   )


Hypothetical "Best-Case" Interpretation
Even if we ignore syntax and compare concepts:

Preconditions: 0% match (LLM uses undefined structures).

Effects: 0% match (none declared).

Similarity: 1 - (3 + 2)/(3 + 2) = 0 (complete mismatch).
