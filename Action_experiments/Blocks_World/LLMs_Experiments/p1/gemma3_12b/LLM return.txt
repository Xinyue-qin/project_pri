Okay, I will generate the PDDL domain with the actions you've described, 
using only the provided predicates.

```pddl
(define (domain logistics)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types block)

  (:predicates
    (arm-empty)
    (holding ?x - block)
    (clear ?x - block)
    (on ?x - block ?y - block)
    (on-table ?x - block)
  )

  (:action putdown
    :parameters (?x - block)
    :precondition (and (holding ?x))
    :effect (and (not (holding ?x)) (arm-empty) (clear ?x))
  )

  (:action pickup
    :parameters (?x - block)
    :precondition (and (arm-empty) (clear ?x))
    :effect (and (holding ?x) (not (arm-empty)) (not (clear ?x)))
  )

  (:action stack
    :parameters (?x - block ?y - block)
    :precondition (and (holding ?x) (clear ?y))
    :effect (and (on ?x ?y) (clear ?x) (not (clear ?y)) (not (holding ?x)) 
(arm-empty))
  )

  (:action unstack
    :parameters (?x - block ?y - block)
    :precondition (and (holding ?x) (on ?x ?y) (clear ?x))
    :effect (and (clear ?y) (not (clear ?x)) (not (holding ?x)) 
(arm-empty) (not (on ?x ?y)))
  )
)
```

**Explanation and Considerations:**

*   **Domain Definition:** The `(define (domain logistics))` line declares 
the domain name.
*   **Requirements:**  `:requirements :strips :typing`  indicates that 
this domain uses STRIPS-like effects (add/delete lists) and supports 
types.  STRIPS is a basic planning paradigm.
*   **Types:**  `:types block` defines the `block` type.  This allows us 
to use `?x - block` to specify that the parameters are of the `block` 
type.
*   **Predicates:**  The `:predicates` section lists all the 
predicates that are used in the domain.
*   **Actions:** Each action is defined as follows:
    *   `(:action <action_name>)`:  Declares the action name.
    *   `:parameters (<parameter_list>)`: Defines the parameters of the 
action.  Each parameter is given a name and a type.
    *   `:precondition (<condition>)`:  Specifies the conditions that must 
be true for the action to be applicable.
    *   `:effect (<condition>)`: Specifies the changes to the world state 
that result from performing the action.  Effects are expressed as 
add/delete lists (though in this STRIPS-like formulation, we simply list 
predicates that become true or false).

**Key Points & Assumptions:**

*   **Clear vs. On-Table:** I assume that a block is considered "clear" if 
nothing is on top of it *or* if it's on the table.  The domain does not 
explicitly differentiate between these two scenarios.
*   **Arm Empty:**  After a `putdown` or `unstack` actionxw, the arm is 
considered empty. After a `pickup` or `stack` action, the arm is not 
empty.
*   **Parameter Ordering:**  In the `stack` and `unstack` actions, 
the order of parameters is important:  `?x` is the block being moved, and 
`?y` is the block it's being moved onto or from.
*   **Typing:** The `:typing` requirement means we're using type 
specifications.
*   **STRIPS Effects:** The effects are simple "add" and "delete" lists 
implicit in the predicate listings (e.g., `(not (holding ?x))` means 
`holding ?x` is deleted).
