Here's the complete PDDL domain definition for `blocksworld-4ops` with the 
specified actions and allowed predicates:

```pddl
(define (domain blocksworld-4ops)
  (:requirements :strips)

  ;; Predicates
  (:predicates
    (arm-empty)
    (holding ?x - block)
    (clear ?x - block)
    (on ?x - block ?y - block)
    (on-table ?x - block)
  )

  ;; Action: putdown
  (:action putdown
    :parameters (?x - block)
    :precondition (and (holding ?x))
    :effect (and (not (holding ?x)) (arm-empty) (clear ?x))
  )

  ;; Action: pickup
  (:action pickup
    :parameters (?x - block)
    :precondition (and (arm-empty) (clear ?x) (on-table ?x))
    :effect (and (not (arm-empty)) (not (clear ?x)) (not (on-table ?x)) 
(holding ?x))
  )

  ;; Action: stack
  (:action stack
    :parameters (?x - block ?y - block)
    :precondition (and (holding ?x) (clear ?y))
    :effect (and (not (holding ?x)) (arm-empty) (on ?x ?y) (clear ?x) (not 
(clear ?y)))
  )

  ;; Action: unstack
  (:action unstack
    :parameters (?x - block ?y - block)
    :precondition (and (arm-empty) (clear ?x) (on ?x ?y))
    :effect (and (not (arm-empty)) (not (clear ?x)) (not (on ?x ?y)) 
(holding ?x) (clear ?y))
  )
)
```

This domain includes the four actions: `putdown`, `pickup`, `stack`, and 
`unstack` with their respective preconditions and effects defined using 
only the allowed predicates.
