Given descriptions of each action in some domain, convert it to Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) action. You need to return me the complete new 'blocksworld-4ops' domain with the predicates I have given you and the new actions you generate. You may only use the allowed predicates for each action.
Allowed Predicates:

(arm-empty) : the robot arm is empty.

(holding ?x - block): block x is held.

(clear ?x - block): block x is clear.

(on ?x - block ?y - block) : block x is on block y.

(on-table ?x - block): block x is on the table.

Output:
The action "putdown" will have the robot arm put down a block, if the robot arm is holding that block.
The action "pickup" will have the robot arm pick up a block, if the block is clear, on the table, and the robot arm is empty.
The action "stack" will have the robot arm stack one block on another block, if the robot arm is holding the first block and the second block is clear.
The action "unstack" will have the robot arm pick up a block that was stacked on another block, if the top block is clear, on top of the bottom block, and the robot arm is empty.
