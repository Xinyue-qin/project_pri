Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by defining the PDDL domain for hiking 
using the allowed predicates you've provided. Here are the actions as specified:

1. **walk**: A hiker moves from one location to another.
2. **rest**: A hiker recovers energy at a location.
3. **check-weather**: Updates the weather status of a location.

Let's write these actions in PDDL format and combine them into a complete domain 
definition:

```pddl
(define (domain hiking)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)

  ;; Define types for hiker and location
  (:types hiker location)

  ;; Define predicates
  (:predicates
    (at ?h - hiker ?l - location)
    (rained ?l - location)
    (has-energy ?h - hiker)
    (path-clear ?from - location ?to - location)
  )

  ;; Action: walk
  (:action walk
    :parameters (?h - hiker ?from - location ?to - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?h ?from) (has-energy ?h) (path-clear ?from ?to))
    :effect (and (not (at ?h ?from)) (at ?h ?to))
  )

  ;; Action: rest
  (:action rest
    :parameters (?h - hiker ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?h ?l) (has-energy ?h))
    :effect (and (not (has-energy ?h)))
  )

  ;; Action: check-weather
  (:action check-weather
    :parameters (?l - location)
    :precondition (true)
    :effect (rained ?l)
  )
)

;; Notes:
;;
;; The `walk` action allows a hiker to move from one location to another if the 
path is clear and the hiker has energy.
;; The `rest` action allows a hiker to rest at a location, which would likely need 
more specifics about how energy is regained.
;; The `check-weather` action updates whether it's raining at a specific location.

```

This PDDL domain definition includes:

1. **Types**: Defined types for `hiker` and `location`.
2. **Predicates**:
   - `(at ?h ?l)`: A hiker is currently at a specific location.
   - `(rained ?l)`: Indicates whether it is raining at a given location.
   - `(has-energy ?h)`: A hiker has sufficient energy to perform actions.
   - `(path-clear ?from ?to)`: A traversable path exists between two locations.

3. **Actions**:
   - `walk`: Moves the hiker from one location to another if there is a clear path 
and the hiker has energy.
   - `rest`: Allows the hiker to rest at a location (though this action would need 
more details on how energy is regained).
   - `check-weather`: Updates the weather status of a location.

You can use this domain definition as part of your planning problem.
