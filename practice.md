## Prompt and result for the action generation (put-down) for the BLOCKS domain
```diff
- Task Signature = [input: NL instruction, PDDL domain predicates; output: PDDL action]
```

**Prompt**:
Given a description of an action in some domain, convert it to Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) action. You may only use the allowed predicates for each action. 

Allowed Predicates: - (handempty) : the hand is empty. - (holding ?x - block): block x is held. - (clear ?x - block): block x is clear. - (on ?x - block ?y - block) : block x is on block y. - (ontable ?x - block): block x is on the table. 

Input: The action, “put-down” will have the hand put down a block. 

PDDL Action:

**Result of devstral**: (ollama run devstral)

Sure! Here's how you can define the "put-down" action in PDDL using the 
allowed predicates:

```pddl
(:action put-down
    :parameters (?x - block)
    :precondition (holding ?x)
    :effect (and
              (not (holding ?x))
              (handempty)
              (ontable ?x)
            )
)
```

Explanation:
- Parameters: The action takes one parameter, `?x`, which represents a 
block.
- Precondition: The hand must be holding the block (`(holding ?x)`).
- Effect: After performing the action, the block is no longer being held 
by the hand (`(not (holding ?x))`), the hand becomes empty 
(`(handempty)`), and the block is now on the table (`(ontable ?x)`).

## Problem generation in blocksworld domain (init=holding one)
```diff
- Task Signature = [input: NL instruction, PDDL domain; output: PDDL problem]
```
**Prompt**

Provide me with the complete, valid problem PDDL file that describes the following planning problem directly without further explanations or texts.
The domain for the planning problem is:

(define (domain blocksworld) (:requirements :strips) (:predicates (arm-empty) (clear ?x) (holding ?x) (on ?x ?y) (on-table ?x)) (:action pickup :parameters (?ob) :precondition (and (clear ?ob) (on-table ?ob) (arm-empty)) :effect (and (holding ?ob) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (ontable ?ob)) (not (arm-empty))) ) (:action putdown :parameters (?ob) :precondition (holding ?ob) :effect (and (clear ?ob) (arm-empty) (on-table ?ob) (not (holding ?ob))) ) (:action stack :parameters (?ob ?underob) :precondition (and (clear ?underob) (holding ?ob)) :effect (and (arm-empty) (clear ?ob) (on ?ob ?underob) (not (clear ?underob)) (not (holding ?ob))) ) (:action unstack :parameters (?ob ?underob) :precondition (and (on ?ob ?underob) (clear ?ob)
(arm-empty)) :effect (and (holding ?ob) (clear ?underob) (not (on ?ob ?underob)) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (arm-empty))) ))

Planning problem:

You have 17 blocks. You are holding b1. b2 is clear. b2 is on the table. b3 is clear. b3 is on the table. b4 is clear. b4 is on the table. b5 is clear. b5 is on the table. b6 is clear. b6 is on the table. b7 is clear. b7 is on the table. b8 is clear. b8 is on the table. b9 is clear. b9 is on
the table. b10 is clear. b10 is on the table. b11 is clear. b11 is on the table. b12 is clear. b12 is on the table. b13 is clear. b13 is on the table. b14 is clear. b14 is on the table. b15 is clear. b15 is on the table. b16 is clear. b16 is on the table. b17 is clear. b17 is on the table.
Your goal is to stack the blocks into a towers of heights 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 9.

The goal is not correct, I need a specific goal that ensures the blocks 
are stacked in the required heights.

## Plan generation in blocksworld domain (init=on table, goal=tower)

```diff
- Task Signature = [input: PDDL domain, PDDL problem; output: Plan]
```

**Prompt**

Given a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file, come up with the plan associated with the problem. The domain describes the possible actions and their effects, while the problem file details the specific scenario to be solved. Do not generate anything but the correct plan.

Domain PDDL:

(define (domain blocksworld) (:requirements :strips) (:predicates (arm-empty) (clear ?x)(holding ?x) (on ?x ?y) (on-table ?x)) (:action pickup :parameters (?ob) :precondition (and (clear ?ob) (on-table ?ob) (arm-empty)) :effect (and (holding ?ob) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (ontable ?ob)) (not (arm-empty)))) (:action putdown :parameters (?ob) :precondition (holding ?ob) :effect (and (clear ?ob) (arm-empty) (on-table ?ob) (not (holding ?ob))) ) (:action stack :parameters (?ob ?underob) :precondition (and (clear ?underob) (holding ?ob)) :effect (and (arm-empty) (clear ?ob) (on ?ob ?underob) (not (clear ?underob)) (not (holding ?ob))) ) (:action unstack :parameters (?ob ?underob) :precondition (and (on ?ob ?underob) (clear ?ob)
(arm-empty)) :effect (and (holding ?ob) (clear ?underob) (not (on ?ob ?underob)) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (arm-empty))) ))

Problem PDDL:

(define (problem on table to tower 1 1 1 1 3 13)(:domain blocksworld)(:requirements :strips)(:objects b1 b10 b11 b12 b13 b14 b15 b16 b17 b18 b19 b2 b20 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9)(:init (arm-empty) (clear b1) (clear b10) (clear b11) (clear b12) (clear b13) (clear b14) (clear b15) (clear b16) (clear b17) (clear b18) (clear b19) (clear b2) (clear b20) (clear b3) (clear b4) (clear b5) (clear b6) (clear b7) (clear b8) (clear b9) (on-table b1) (on-table b10) (on-table b11) (on-table b12) (on-table b13) (on-table b14) (on-table b15) (on-table b16) (on-table b17) (on-table b18) (on-table b19) (on-table b2) (on-table b20) (on-table b3) (ontable b4) (on-table b5) (on-table b6) (on-table b7) (on-table b8) (on-table b9))(:goal (and (arm-empty) (clear b1) (on-table b1) (clear b2) (on-table b2) (clear b3) (on-table b3) (clear b4) (on-table b4) (clear b5) (on b5 b6) (on b6 b7) (on-table b7) (clear b8) (on b8 b9) (on b9 b10) (on b10 b11) (on b11 b12) (on b12 b13) (on b13 b14) (on b14 b15) (on b15 b16) (on b16 b17) (on b17 b18) (on b18 b19) (on b19 b20) (on-table b20))))

Plan:

**Result of devstral**: (ollama run devstral)

To generate a plan for the given PDDL problem, we need to analyze the 
initial state and goal state described in the problem file. The domain 
defines the possible actions that can be taken in this blocks world.

Let's break down what needs to happen:

1. **Initial State**:
   - All blocks (b1 through b20) are on the table.
   - All blocks are clear (no block is stacked on top of any other).

2. **Goal State**:
   - Blocks b4, b5, and b6-7 should remain on the table individually.
   - Create a tower with blocks b8-b20 in this order: b8 on b9, b9 on b10, 
etc., up to b20.

Given these requirements, we need to:
1. Stack blocks b5 on b6 and b6 on b7 to create a small tower.
2. Create the larger tower from b8 through b20.

Now let's generate the plan:

```
(pickup b4)
(putdown b4)

(pickup b3)
(putdown b3)

(pickup b2)
(putdown b2)

(pickup b1)
(putdown b1)

(pickup b5)
(pickup b6)
(stack b6 b5)

(pickup b7)
(stack b7 b6)

(pickup b8)
(pickup b9)
(stack b9 b8)

(pickup b10)
(stack b10 b9)

(pickup b11)
(stack b11 b10)

(pickup b12)
(stack b12 b11)

(pickup b13)
(stack b13 b12)

(pickup b14)
(stack b14 b13)

(pickup b15)
(stack b15 b14)

(pickup b16)
(stack b16 b15)

(pickup b17)
(stack b17 b16)

(pickup b18)
(stack b18 b17)

(pickup b19)
(stack b19 b18)

(pickup b20)
(stack b20 b19)
```

This plan ensures that the goal state is reached by:
- Maintaining blocks b4, b3, b2, and b1 on the table individually.
- Building a small tower with b5, b6, and b7 where b7 is on top of b6 
which is on top of b5.
- Creating a larger tower from b8 to b20 as specified in the goal.

**Result of Gemma3:**

```

Here’s a plan for solving the problem, based on the provided PDDL:

**Phase 1: Initial State Assessment & Planning**

1. **State Representation:**  Establish a clear representation of the 
problem state. This is crucial.  We'll need to track:
   * `arm-empty`:  Whether the tower is empty.
   * `clear`:  Whether a particular object is clear.
   * `holding`:  Whether an object is held.
   * `on-table`:  Whether an object is on the table.
   * `objects`: A list of objects.  (e.g., `b1`, `b2`, etc.).
2. **Goal Identification:**  Explicitly define the goal.  In this case, it’
s `b1` to be on the table and `b2` to be in the tower.

**Phase 2: Core Action Sequence - Picking up and placing objects**

1. **Pickup:**  Start with the pickup action (pick up `b1`).  The pickup 
should be performed when the tower is empty and the object `b1` is clear.
2. **Placement:** After the pickup, start with the placement action (put 
down `b1`).  The placement should be performed when the tower is empty and 
the object `b1` is holding.
3. **Stack:** After the placement, start with the stack action (stack 
`b1`). This will move the object `b1` to the stack.
4. **Unstack:** After the stack, start with the unstack action (unstack 
`b1`).  This will move the object `b1` from the stack to the top of the 
tower.

**Phase 3:  Iterative Expansion - Adding more Objects**

1. **Repeat:** Continue the pickup and placement steps until the goal is 
achieved (b1 is on the table and b2 is in the tower).
2. **Add Objects:**  After a successful pickup and placement, add the next 
object from the `objects` list. This will continue to build the tower.

**Key Considerations & Potential Refinements:**

* **Error Handling:**  The PDDL doesn't explicitly specify what to do if a 
state is unreachable (e.g., when the tower is full and you can't pick up 
anything).  It would be valuable to add a "recover" action or a 
conditional statement to handle these situations.
* **Efficiency:** The plan prioritizes the initial pickup and placement.  
Consider adding strategies for preventing redundant actions (e.g., if a 
piece is already on the table, don't try to add another one).

This plan provides a fundamental approach to solving the problem based on 
the provided PDDL.  It's a starting point that can be refined and extended 
as needed to address specific requirements and potential edge cases.
