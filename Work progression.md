## Progression on project in last week:
1. I have deployed the fast downwards on the computer, with its accompanying tools (VAL, report generatingâ€¦);
2. I worked to be more familiar with PDDL syntax;
3. I have given the prompt (NL instruction, PDDL domain predicates) to Gemma3 and Devstral, and asked them to generate action;
4. Reading relevant past paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20175);

## Question:
1. What criteria or benchmark should I use to evaluate the result of the PDDL code LLMs generated?
