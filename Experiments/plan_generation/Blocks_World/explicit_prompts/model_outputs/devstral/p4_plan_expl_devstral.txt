1. Identify the initial state.
2. Understand the goal state.
3. Create a sequence of actions that transform the initial state into the goal state using the defined operations.
Initial State:
- The arm is empty: `(arm-empty)`
- Blocks A, B, C, and D are on the table and clear: `(clear A) (clear B) (clear C) (clear D) (on-table A) (on-table B) (on-table C) (on-table D)`
Goal State:
- Block A is on block B: `(on A B)`
- Block C is on block D: `(on C D)`
Now, let's create a plan to achieve the goal state from the initial state:
1. **Pick up block A**: `pickup(A)`
- Precondition: `(clear A) (on-table A) (arm-empty)`
- Effect: `(holding A) (not (clear A)) (not (on-table A)) (not (arm-empty))`
2. **Stack block A on block B**: `stack(A, B)`
- Precondition: `(clear B) (holding A)`
- Effect: `(arm-empty) (clear A) (on A B) (not (clear B)) (not (holding A))`
3. **Pick up block C**: `pickup(C)`
- Precondition: `(clear C) (on-table C) (arm-empty)`
- Effect: `(holding C) (not (clear C)) (not (on-table C)) (not (arm-empty))`
4. **Stack block C on block D**: `stack(C, D)`
- Precondition: `(clear D) (holding C)`
- Effect: `(arm-empty) (clear C) (on C D) (not (clear D)) (not (holding C))`
So the plan is:
1. `pickup(A)`
2. `stack(A, B)`
3. `pickup(C)`
4. `stack(C, D)`
Plan:
```
(pickup A)
(stack A B)
(pickup C)
(stack C D)
```
