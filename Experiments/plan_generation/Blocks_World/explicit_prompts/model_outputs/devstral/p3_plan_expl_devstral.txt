Let's break down the steps required:
### Initial State:
- `arm-empty`
- `(clear B) (on B A) (on-table A)`
- `(clear D) (on D C) (on-table C)`
### Goal State:
- `(on A B) (on B C) (on C D) (on-table D)`
Let's plan the sequence of actions step by step:
1. **Pick up block D**:
- Preconditions: `arm-empty`, `clear D`, `on-table D`
- Effect: `holding D`, `not clear D`, `not on-table D`, `not arm-empty`
2. **Put down block D on table**:
- Preconditions: `holding D`
- Effect: `clear D`, `arm-empty`, `on-table D`, `not holding D`
3. **Pick up block C**:
- Preconditions: `arm-empty`, `clear C`, `on-table C`
- Effect: `holding C`, `not clear C`, `not on-table C`, `not arm-empty`
4. **Put down block C on D**:
- Preconditions: `holding C`, `clear D` (from step 2)
- Effect: `clear C`, `arm-empty`, `(on C D)`, `not holding C`
- Note: `not clear D` because C is now on top of D
5. **Pick up block B**:
- Preconditions: `arm-empty`, `clear B`, `on-table A` (B was on A)
- Effect: `holding B`, `not clear B`, `(not on B A)`, `not arm-empty`
6. **Put down block B on C**:
- Preconditions: `holding B`, `clear C`
- Effect: `clear B`, `arm-empty`, `(on B C)`, `not holding B`
- Note: `not clear C` because B is now on top of C
7. **Pick up block A**:
- Preconditions: `arm-empty`, `clear A`, `on-table A`
- Effect: `holding A`, `not clear A`, `(not on-table A)`, `not arm-empty`
8. **Put down block A on B**:
- Preconditions: `holding A`, `clear B`
- Effect: `clear A`, `arm-empty`, `(on A B)`, `not holding A`
- Note: `not clear B` because A is now on top of B
Now we have achieved the goal state:
- Block A is on block B
- Block B is on block C
- Block C is on block D
- Block D is on the table
### Plan in PDDL Actions:
```
(pickup D)
(putdown D)
(pickup C)
(stack C D)
(pickup B)
(stack B C)
(pickup A)
(stack A B)
```
This plan successfully transforms the initial state into the goal state.
