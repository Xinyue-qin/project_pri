Let's break down the steps needed:
### Initial State:
- The arm is empty.
- Block A is on the table.
- Block B is on block A.
- Block C is on block B (and clear).
- Block D is on the table.
- Block E is on block D (and clear).
### Goal State:
- Block A should be on block C, and block C should be on the table.
- Block B should be on block E, and block E should be on the table.
- Block D should be on block B.
To achieve this goal state from the initial state, we'll follow these steps:
1. **Unstack C from B**: `(unstack C B)`
2. **Putdown C on the table**: `(putdown C)`
3. **Unstack B from A**: `(unstack B A)`
4. **Stack B onto E**: `(stack B E)` (E was already clear and on D, now D is free)
5. **Pickup A**: `(pickup A)`
6. **Stack A onto C**: `(stack A C)`
Let's verify the steps:
1. **Initial State**:
- `arm-empty`
- `on-table A`
- `on B A`
- `clear C`
- `on-table D`
- `clear E`
2. **After Unstacking C from B**:
- `holding C`
- `clear B`
- `not (on C B)`
3. **After Putting down C on the table**:
- `clear C`
- `arm-empty`
- `on-table C`
4. **After Unstacking B from A**:
- `holding B`
- `clear A`
5. **After Stacking B onto E**:
- `clear B`
- `on B E`
- `arm-empty`
6. **After Picking up A**:
- `holding A`
7. **After Stacking A onto C**:
- `clear A`
- `on A C`
- `arm-empty`
8. **Final State**:
- Block A is on block C, and block C is on the table.
- Block B is on block E, and block E is on the table.
Given these steps, here's the final plan:
1. `(unstack C B)`
2. `(putdown C)`
3. `(unstack B A)`
4. `(stack B E)`
5. `(pickup A)`
6. `(stack A C)`
