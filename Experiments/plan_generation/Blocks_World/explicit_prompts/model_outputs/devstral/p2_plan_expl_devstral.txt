Let's break down the steps:
### Initial State:
- arm-empty
- (clear C)
- (on-table A)
- (on B A)
- (on C B)
### Goal State:
- (on-table C)
- (on B C)
- (on A B)
Let's work through the plan step by step:
1. **unstack C from B**
- Precondition: (clear C) ∧ (arm-empty) ∧ (on C B)
- Effect: (holding C) ∧ (clear B) ∧ ¬(on C B) ∧ ¬(clear C) ∧ ¬(arm-empty)
2. **putdown C on table**
- Precondition: (holding C)
- Effect: (clear C) ∧ (arm-empty) ∧ (on-table C) ∧ ¬(holding C)
3. **unstack B from A**
- Precondition: (clear B) ∧ (arm-empty) ∧ (on B A)
- Effect: (holding B) ∧ (clear A) ∧ ¬(on B A) ∧ ¬(clear B) ∧ ¬(arm-empty)
4. **stack B on C**
- Precondition: (clear C) ∧ (holding B)
- Effect: (arm-empty) ∧ (clear B) ∧ (on B C) ∧ ¬(clear C) ∧ ¬(holding B)
5. **unstack A from table**
- Precondition: (clear A) ∧ (arm-empty) ∧ (on-table A)
- Effect: (holding A) ∧ (clear A) ∧ ¬(on-table A) ∧ ¬(clear A) ∧ ¬(arm-empty)
6. **stack A on B**
- Precondition: (clear B) ∧ (holding A)
- Effect: (arm-empty) ∧ (clear A) ∧ (on A B) ∧ ¬(clear B) ∧ ¬(holding A)
### Final Plan:
1. (unstack C B)
2. (putdown C)
3. (unstack B A)
4. (stack B C)
5. (pickup A)
6. (stack A B)
