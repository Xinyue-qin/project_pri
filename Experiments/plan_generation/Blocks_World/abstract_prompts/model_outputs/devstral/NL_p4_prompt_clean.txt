Let's break down what we know:
### Initial State:
- All blocks are scattered on the table.
- Assuming that all blocks (A, B, C, D) are initially clear (i.e., no block is on top of another).
- `arm-empty` is true.
### Goal State:
- Two pairs of blocks stacked: A on B and C on D.
- The other blocks remain unchanged.
Given the problem description, we can infer that we need to stack blocks A onto B and blocks C onto D while ensuring no other blocks are moved unnecessarily. Let's formulate a plan step by step:
1. **Pick up block A:**
- Action: `pickup(A)`
- Preconditions: `(clear A) (on-table A) (arm-empty)`
2. **Stack block A onto B:**
- Action: `stack(A, B)`
- Preconditions: `(clear B) (holding A)`
3. **Pick up block C:**
- Action: `pickup(C)`
- Preconditions: `(clear C) (on-table C) (arm-empty)`  (after putting down A on B)
4. **Stack block C onto D:**
- Action: `stack(C, D)`
- Preconditions: `(clear D) (holding C)`
So the complete plan would be:
1. pickup(A)
2. stack(A, B)
3. pickup(C)
4. stack(C, D)
This plan achieves the goal state of having A on B and C on D while keeping all other blocks in their initial positions if there are no other constraints mentioned.
### Plan:
(pickup A)
(stack A B)
(pickup C)
(stack C D)
