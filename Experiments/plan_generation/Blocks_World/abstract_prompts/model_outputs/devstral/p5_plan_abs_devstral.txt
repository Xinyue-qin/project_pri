Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
Initial State:
- Tower 1: C on B on A (on-table)
- Tower 2: E on D (on-table)
Goal State:
- A is on C (which is on the table),
- B is on E (which is on the table),
- D is on B.
Let's define the steps needed to achieve this goal:
1. **Initial Setup**:
- `clear(C)`, `clear(E)`
- `on(C, B)`, `on(B, A)`, `on(A, TABLE)`
- `on(E, D)`, `on(D, TABLE)`
- `arm-empty`
2. **Plan Steps**:
1. Unstack C from B and pick it up.
- Precondition: `clear(C)` (true), `(on C B)` (true), `arm-empty` (true)
- Effect: `holding(C)`, `clear(B)`
2. Putdown C on the table.
- Precondition: `holding(C)` (from step 1)
- Effect: `clear(C)`, `on-table(C)`, `arm-empty`
3. Unstack A from B and pick it up.
- Precondition: `clear(B)` (after step 2), `(on A B)`, `arm-empty` (true)
- Effect: `holding(A)`, `clear(B)`
4. Stack A on C.
- Precondition: `clear(C)` (from step 2), `holding(A)` (from step 3)
- Effect: `on(A, C)`, `clear(A)`, `arm-empty`
5. Unstack B from A and pick it up.
- Precondition: `clear(A)` (after stack action in step 4), `(on B A)`, `arm-empty` (true)
- Effect: `holding(B)`, `clear(A)`
6. Putdown B on the table.
- Precondition: `holding(B)` (from step 5)
- Effect: `clear(B)`, `on-table(B)`, `arm-empty`
7. Unstack E from D and pick it up.
- Precondition: `clear(E)` (true), `(on E D)`, `arm-empty` (true)
- Effect: `holding(E)`, `clear(D)`
8. Putdown E on the table.
- Precondition: `holding(E)` (from step 7)
- Effect: `clear(E)`, `on-table(E)`, `arm-empty`
9. Stack B on E.
- Precondition: `clear(E)` (from step 8), `holding(B)` (true, putdown earlier)
- Effect: `on(B, E)`, `clear(B)`, `arm-empty`
10. Unstack D from the table and pick it up.
- Precondition: `clear(D)` (after unstack in step 7), `(on D TABLE)`, `arm-empty` (true)
- Effect: `holding(D)`, `clear(D)`
11. Stack D on B.
- Precondition: `clear(B)` (from stack action in step 9), `holding(D)` (from step 10)
- Effect: `on(D, B)`, `clear(D)`, `arm-empty`
**Plan**:
```
(unstack C B) -> (putdown C) ->
(unstack A B) -> (stack A C) ->
(unstack B A) -> (putdown B) ->
(unstack E D) -> (putdown E) ->
(stack B E) ->
(unstack D TABLE) -> (stack D B)
```
