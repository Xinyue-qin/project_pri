Given a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem natural language description, come up with the plan associated with the problem. The domain describes the possible actions and their effects, while the problem description details the specific scenario to be solved. Do not generate anything but the correct plan.

Domain PDDL:
(define (domain delivery)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)

  (:types
    agent package location - object
  )

  (:predicates
    (at ?a - agent ?l - location)

Problem description:
Initial State:
A delivery drone starts at a depot with a medical package that needs to be delivered to a disaster area through an intermediate hospital location, as there is no direct connection.

Goal State:
The medical package is successfully delivered to the disaster area, requiring transit through the hospital.

Plan:
