Here's a step-by-step plan:
1. **Pick up the package at the depot**:
- Action: `pick-up`
- Parameters: `(agent, package, location)`
- Preconditions: (at ?a ?l), (in ?p ?l), (available ?a)
- Effect: (has ?a ?p), not(in ?p ?l)
2. **Move from the depot to the hospital**:
- Action: `move`
- Parameters: `(agent, location_from, location_to)`
- Preconditions: (at ?a ?from), (connected ?from ?to), (available ?a)
- Effect: (at ?a ?to), not(at ?a ?from)
3. **Move from the hospital to the disaster area**:
- Action: `move`
- Parameters: `(agent, location_from, location_to)`
- Preconditions: (at ?a ?from), (connected ?from ?to), (available ?a)
- Effect: (at ?a ?to), not(at ?a ?from)
4. **Drop off the package at the disaster area**:
- Action: `drop-off`
- Parameters: `(agent, package, location)`
- Preconditions: (has ?a ?p), (at ?a ?l), (requested ?p ?l)
- Effect: (delivered ?p), (in ?p ?l), not(has ?a ?p)
Here is the plan in a structured format:
1. `(pick-up drone1 package1 depot)`
2. `(move drone1 depot hospital)`
3. `(move drone1 hospital disaster_area)`
4. `(drop-off drone1 package1 disaster_area)`
This sequence of actions ensures that the medical package is successfully delivered to the disaster area, passing through the hospital as required by the problem description.
