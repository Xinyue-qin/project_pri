First, we need to understand what the initial state is and how it relates to the goal state. Then, we'll formulate a sequence of actions that will achieve the desired outcome.
### Initial State Understanding
1. Two robots (agents) are at different locations.
2. There's a package at one location.
3. The network of locations is connected.
### Goal State Understanding
- Deliver the package to a final destination, possibly involving coordination between two robots.
### Plan
Let's assume the following:
- Robot 1 (`r1`) and Robot 2 (`r2`) are our agents.
- `L1` is the starting location where the package is located.
- `L2` is the intermediate location (where `r2` might be initially).
- `L3` is the final destination for the package.
Here’s a step-by-step plan to achieve this:
1. **Robot 1 (`r1`) Picks Up the Package at Location L1:**
```
(pick-up r1 package1 L1)
```
2. **Robot 1 Moves from L1 to L2 (Intermediate Location):**
```
(move r1 L1 L2)
```
3. **Robot 1 Drops Off the Package at L2 for Robot 2:**
```
(drop-off r1 package1 L2)
```
4. **Robot 2 Picks Up the Package from Location L2:**
```
(pick-up r2 package1 L2)
```
5. **Robot 2 Moves from L2 to the Final Destination (L3):**
```
(move r2 L2 L3)
```
6. **Robot 2 Drops Off the Package at the Final Destination:**
```
(drop-off r2 package1 L3)
```
### Complete Plan
```
(pick-up r1 package1 L1)
(move r1 L1 L2)
(drop-off r1 package1 L2)
(pick-up r2 package1 L2)
(move r2 L2 L3)
(drop-off r2 package1 L3)
```
