1. Parse the domain and problem descriptions
2. Create a planning graph or search tree based on actions and preconditions/effects
3. Use A* or some heuristic search algorithm to find the optimal path to achieve the goal state
Let's break this down into a series of commands I'll execute:
1. First, let's define the initial and goal states from the problem description.
2. Then we'll explore possible actions and their preconditions/effects to create our plan.
Let me start by extracting information about locations, packages, and connections:
```python
import re
# Extract predicates from domain
predicates = [
"at(agent, location)",
"has(agent, package)",
"in(package, location)",
"connected(location1, location2)",
"requested(package, location)",
"delivered(package)",
"available(agent)"
]
# Extract actions and their parameters
actions = {
"pick-up": ["agent", "package", "location"],
"move": ["agent", "from_location", "to_location"],
"drop-off": ["agent", "package", "location"]
}
# Extract action preconditions and effects
action_details = {
"pick-up": {
"precondition": [
"at(agent, location)",
"in(package, location)",
"available(agent)"
],
"effect": [
"has(agent, package)",
"(not in(package, location))"
]
},
"move": {
"precondition": [
"at(agent, from_location)",
"connected(from_location, to_location)",
"available(agent)"
],
"effect": [
"at(agent, to_location)",
"(not at(agent, from_location))"
]
},
"drop-off": {
"precondition": [
"has(agent, package)",
"at(agent, location)",
"requested(package, location)"
],
"effect": [
"delivered(package)",
"in(package, location)",
"(not has(agent, package))"
]
}
}
```
Now that I have the structure of the domain defined in code, let's get some more information from you about the specific problem instance. Could you provide me with:
1. The initial locations of the robot and packages
2. The requested delivery destinations for each package
3. The connections between different locations
This will help me generate a valid plan to solve this particular problem.
