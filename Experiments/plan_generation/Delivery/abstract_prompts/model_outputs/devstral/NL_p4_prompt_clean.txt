1. The agents' starting locations
2. The locations of their respective packages
3. The destination where both packages should be delivered
4. The connectivity between locations
Since the specific details are missing from the provided information, I'll create a plausible scenario based on typical delivery problems:
### Initial State:
- Agents: A1, A2
- Packages: P1 (held by A1), P2 (held by A2)
- Locations: L1, L2 (starting locations), L3 (destination location for both packages)
- Connectivity: connected(L1, L4), connected(L2, L5), connected(L4, L3), connected(L5, L3)
### Plan:
1. Both agents start at their respective locations with the packages.
2. Each agent delivers their package to the destination location.
Let's define this in PDDL terms:
```pddl
(define (problem delivery-problem)
(:domain delivery)
(:objects
A1 A2 - agent
P1 P2 - package
L1 L2 L3 L4 L5 - location
)
(:init
;; Agents' initial positions
(at A1 L1)
(at A2 L2)
;; Initial availability of agents
(available A1)
(available A2)
;; Packages' initial locations and requests
(has A1 P1)
(has A2 P2)
(requested P1 L3)
(requested P2 L3)
;; Connectivity between locations
(connected L1 L4)
(connected L2 L5)
(connected L4 L3)
(connected L5 L3)
)
(:goal
(and
(delivered P1)
(delivered P2)
)
)
)
```
Now, to create the correct plan for this scenario:
### Plan Steps:
1. Move A1 from L1 to L4.
2. Move A1 from L4 to L3.
3. Drop-off package P1 at L3 by agent A1.
4. Move A2 from L2 to L5.
5. Move A2 from L5 to L3.
6. Drop-off package P2 at L3 by agent A2.
In PDDL plan syntax:
```pddl
(move A1 L1 L4)
(move A1 L4 L3)
(drop-off A1 P1 L3)
(move A2 L2 L5)
(move A2 L5 L3)
(drop-off A2 P2 L3)
```
This is the correct plan for delivering both packages to the destination location.
