Given a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem natural language description, come up with the plan associated with the problem. The domain describes the possible actions and their effects, while the problem description details the specific scenario to be solved. Do not generate anything but the correct plan.

Domain PDDL:
(define (domain delivery)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)

  (:types
    agent package location - object
  )

  (:predicates
    (at ?a - agent ?l - location)
    (has ?a - agent ?p - package)
    (in ?p - package ?l - location)
    (connected ?from - location ?to - location)
    (requested ?p - package ?dest - location)
    (delivered ?p - package)
    (available ?a - agent)
  )

  (:action pick-up
    :parameters (?a - agent ?p - package ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?a ?l) (in ?p ?l) (available ?a))
    :effect (and 
              (has ?a ?p)
              (not (in ?p ?l))
            )

  (:action drop-off
    :parameters (?a - agent ?p - package ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (has ?a ?p) (at ?a ?l) (requested ?p ?l))
    :effect (and
