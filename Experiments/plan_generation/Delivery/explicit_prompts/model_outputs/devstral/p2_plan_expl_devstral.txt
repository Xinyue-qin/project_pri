### Initial State:
- Robot2 (an agent) is at loc1.
- Package pkgA is in loc1.
- Package pkgB is in loc2.
- Locations are connected: loc1 to loc2, loc2 to loc3.
- Package pkgA is requested at loc3.
- Package pkgB is requested at loc1.
- Robot2 is available.
### Goal State:
Both package pkgA and package pkgB should be delivered to their respective destinations (pkgA to loc3 and pkgB to loc1).
### Plan:
1. **Pick up pkgA from loc1**:
- Action: `(pick-up Robot2 pkgA loc1)`
- Preconditions: `(at Robot2 loc1) (in pkgA loc1) (available Robot2)` - All are true
- Effects: `Robot2 has pkgA, pkgA is no longer in loc1`
2. **Move from loc1 to loc2**:
- Action: `(move Robot2 loc1 loc2)`
- Preconditions: `(at Robot2 loc1) (connected loc1 loc2) (available Robot2)` - All are true
- Effects: `Robot2 is now at loc2, not at loc1`
3. **Move from loc2 to loc3**:
- Action: `(move Robot2 loc2 loc3)`
- Preconditions: `(at Robot2 loc2) (connected loc2 loc3) (available Robot2)` - All are true
- Effects: `Robot2 is now at loc3, not at loc2`
4. **Drop off pkgA in loc3**:
- Action: `(drop-off Robot2 pkgA loc3)`
- Preconditions: `(has Robot2 pkgA) (at Robot2 loc3) (requested pkgA loc3)` - All are true
- Effects: `pkgA is delivered, pkgA is now at loc3, Robot2 no longer has pkgA`
5. **Move from loc3 to loc2**:
- Action: `(move Robot2 loc3 loc2)`
- Preconditions: `(at Robot2 loc3) (connected loc3 loc2) (available Robot2)` - All are true
- Effects: `Robot2 is now at loc2, not at loc3`
6. **Pick up pkgB from loc2**:
- Action: `(pick-up Robot2 pkgB loc2)`
- Preconditions: `(at Robot2 loc2) (in pkgB loc2) (available Robot2)` - All are true
- Effects: `Robot2 has pkgB, pkgB is no longer in loc2`
7. **Move from loc2 to loc1**:
- Action: `(move Robot2 loc2 loc1)`
- Preconditions: `(at Robot2 loc2) (connected loc2 loc1) (available Robot2)` - All are true
- Effects: `Robot2 is now at loc1, not at loc2`
8. **Drop off pkgB in loc1**:
- Action: `(drop-off Robot2 pkgB loc1)`
- Preconditions: `(has Robot2 pkgB) (at Robot2 loc1) (requested pkgB loc1)` - All are true
- Effects: `pkgB is delivered, pkgB is now at loc1, Robot2 no longer has pkgB`
### Final Plan:
```
(pick-up Robot2 pkgA loc1)
(move Robot2 loc1 loc2)
(move Robot2 loc2 loc3)
(drop-off Robot2 pkgA loc3)
(move Robot2 loc3 loc2)
(pick-up Robot2 pkgB loc2)
(move Robot2 loc2 loc1)
(drop-off Robot2 pkgB loc1)
```
This plan ensures that both packages are delivered to their respective locations.
