1. Courier1 picks up UrgentPkg from warehouse.
2. Courier1 moves to client.
3. Courier1 drops off UrgentPkg at client.
4. Courier2 picks up normalPkg from station.
5. Courier2 moves to client.
6. Courier2 drops off NormalPkg at client.
Plan:
(pick-up courier1 urgentPkg warehouse)
(move courier1 warehouse client)
(drop-off courier1 urgentPkg client)
(pick-up courier2 normalPkg station)
(move courier2 station client)
(drop-off courier2 normalPkg client)
