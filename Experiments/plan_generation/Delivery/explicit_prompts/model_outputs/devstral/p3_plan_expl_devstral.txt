1. **Initial State:**
- RobotA is at locX
- RobotB is at locZ
- Package pkgX is in locX
- Locations are connected: locX to locY, locY to locZ
- Package pkgX is requested at locZ
- Both robots (RobotA and RobotB) are available
2. **Goal State:**
- Package pkgX is delivered
3. **Domain Actions:**
- `pick-up(?a - agent ?p - package ?l - location)`: Requires the agent to be at the location, the package to be in that location, and the agent to be available.
- `move(?a - agent ?from - location ?to - location)`: Requires the agent to move from one connected location to another and for the agent to be available.
- `drop-off(?a - agent ?p - package ?l - location)`: Requires the agent to have the package, be at the destination location, and the package to be requested there.
Given these actions and states, here's the plan:
1. **Pick Up Package:** RobotA picks up pkgX from locX
```pddl
(pick-up RobotA pkgX locX)
```
2. **Move to Destination Location:**
- Move from locX to locY
```pddl
(move RobotA locX locY)
```
- Then move from locY to locZ
```pddl
(move RobotA locY locZ)
```
3. **Drop Off Package:** RobotA drops off pkgX at locZ
```pddl
(drop-off RobotA pkgX locZ)
```
So, the plan is:
```pddl
( pick-up RobotA pkgX locX )
( move RobotA locX locY )
( move RobotA locY locZ )
( drop-off RobotA pkgX locZ )
```
This sequence of actions will deliver package `pkgX` to location `locZ`, satisfying the goal state.
