### Analysis
**Initial State:**
- Locations:
- `loc1` and `airport1` are in `city1`
- `loc2` and `airport2` are in `city2`
- Vehicles:
- `truck1` is at `loc1`
- `truck2` is at `loc2`
- `plane1` is at `airport1`
- Packages:
- `pkg1` is at `loc1`
- `pkg2` is at `airport1`
- `pkg3` is at `airport2`
**Goal State:**
- Packages should be moved to these locations:
- `pkg1` to `loc2`
- `pkg2` to `airport2`
- `pkg3` to `loc1`
### Plan
Here's the step-by-step plan:
1. **Load pkg1 onto truck1 at loc1:**
```
(load pkg1 truck1 loc1)
```
2. **Drive truck1 from loc1 to airport1 in city1:**
```
(drive truck1 loc1 airport1 city1)
```
3. **Fly plane1 from airport1 to airport2:**
```
(fly plane1 airport1 airport2)
```
4. **Unload pkg1 from truck1 at airport1:**
```
(unload pkg1 truck1 airport1)
```
5. **Load pkg1 onto plane1 at airport1:**
```
(load pkg1 plane1 airport1)
```
6. **Fly plane1 from airport1 to airport2:**
```
(fly plane1 airport1 airport2)
```
7. **Unload pkg1 from plane1 at airport2:**
```
(unload pkg1 plane1 airport2)
```
8. **Load pkg3 onto truck2 at loc2:**
```
(load pkg3 truck2 loc2)
```
9. **Drive truck2 from loc2 to airport2 in city2:**
```
(drive truck2 loc2 airport2 city2)
```
10. **Unload pkg3 from truck2 at airport2:**
```
(unload pkg3 truck2 airport2)
```
11. **Load pkg2 onto plane1 at airport2:**
```
(load pkg2 plane1 airport2)
```
12. **Fly plane1 from airport2 to airport1:**
```
(fly plane1 airport2 airport1)
```
13. **Unload pkg2 from plane1 at airport1:**
```
(unload pkg2 plane1 airport1)
```
14. **Load pkg2 onto truck1 at airport1:**
```
(load pkg2 truck1 airport1)
```
15. **Drive truck1 from airport1 to loc1 in city1:**
```
(drive truck1 airport1 loc1 city1)
```
16. **Unload pkg2 from truck1 at loc1:**
```
(unload pkg2 truck1 loc1)
```
Now let's format this as a PDDL plan:
```
(load pkg1 truck1 loc1)
(drive truck1 loc1 airport1 city1)
(fly plane1 airport1 airport2)
(unload pkg1 truck1 airport1)
(load pkg1 plane1 airport1)
(fly plane1 airport1 airport2)
(unload pkg1 plane1 airport2)
(load pkg3 truck2 loc2)
(drive truck2 loc2 airport2 city2)
(unload pkg3 truck2 airport2)
(load pkg2 plane1 airport2)
(fly plane1 airport2 airport1)
(unload pkg2 plane1 airport1)
(load pkg2 truck1 airport1)
(drive truck1 airport1 loc1 city1)
(unload pkg2 truck1 loc1)
```
This sequence of actions should achieve the goal state as specified in the problem description.
