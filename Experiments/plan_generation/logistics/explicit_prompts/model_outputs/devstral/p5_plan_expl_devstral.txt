Let's break down the steps required:
### Initial State
- Locations and Cities:
- loc1 in city1
- loc2 in city2
- loc3 in city3
- Airports:
- airport1 (likely associated with city1)
- airport2 (likely associated with city2)
- airport3 (likely associated with city3)
- Vehicles and their positions:
- truck1 at loc1
- truck2 at loc2
- truck3 at loc3
- plane1 at airport1
- plane2 at airport2
- Packages and their positions:
- pkg1 at loc1
- pkg2 at airport1
- pkg3 at loc2
- pkg4 at airport3
### Goal State
- pkg1 should be at loc3
- pkg2 should be at airport3
- pkg3 should be at loc1
- pkg4 should be at airport2
To achieve this goal, we will use the defined actions in the domain PDDL: load, unload, drive, and fly.
### Plan
1. **Move pkg1 to loc3**:
- Load pkg1 onto truck1 at loc1.
- Drive truck1 from loc1 to loc3 (assuming loc1 and loc3 are in city1).
- Unload pkg1 from truck1 at loc3.
2. **Move pkg2 to airport3**:
- Load pkg2 onto plane1 at airport1.
- Fly plane1 from airport1 to airport3.
- Unload pkg2 from plane1 at airport3.
3. **Move pkg3 to loc1**:
- Load pkg3 onto truck2 at loc2.
- Drive truck2 from loc2 to loc1 (assuming loc1 and loc2 are in city2).
- Unload pkg3 from truck2 at loc1.
4. **Move pkg4 to airport2**:
- Load pkg4 onto plane2 at airport3.
- Fly plane2 from airport3 to airport2.
- Unload pkg4 from plane2 at airport2.
### Formatted Plan in PDDL
```pddl
(define (problem logistics-problem)
(:domain logistics)
(:objects
truck1 truck2 truck3 - truck
plane1 plane2 - airplane
pkg1 pkg2 pkg3 pkg4 - object
loc1 loc2 loc3 - location
airport1 airport2 airport3 - airport
city1 city2 city3 - city
)
(:init
(loc loc1 city1)
(loc loc2 city2)
(loc loc3 city3)
(at truck1 loc1)
(at truck2 loc2)
(at truck3 loc3)
(at plane1 airport1)
(at plane2 airport2)
(at pkg1 loc1)
(at pkg2 airport1)
(at pkg3 loc2)
(at pkg4 airport3)
)
(:goal
(and
(at pkg1 loc3)
(at pkg2 airport3)
(at pkg3 loc1)
(at pkg4 airport2)
)
)
;; Plan to achieve the goal
; Move pkg1 to loc3
(load pkg1 truck1 loc1)
(drive truck1 loc1 loc3 city1)  ; assuming both locations are in the same city
(unload pkg1 truck1 loc3)
; Move pkg2 to airport3
(load pkg2 plane1 airport1)
(fly plane1 airport1 airport3)
(unload pkg2 plane1 airport3)
; Move pkg3 to loc1
(load pkg3 truck2 loc2)
(drive truck2 loc2 loc1 city2)  ; assuming both locations are in the same city
(unload pkg3 truck2 loc1)
; Move pkg4 to airport2
(load pkg4 plane2 airport3)
(fly plane2 airport3 airport2)
(unload pkg4 plane2 airport2)
)
```
This plan uses the defined actions to move each package to its respective goal location, following the constraints and preconditions specified in the domain description.
