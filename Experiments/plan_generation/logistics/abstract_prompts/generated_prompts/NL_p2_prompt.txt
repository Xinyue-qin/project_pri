Given a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem natural language description, come up with the plan associated with the problem. The domain describes the possible actions and their effects, while the problem description details the specific scenario to be solved. Do not generate anything but the correct plan.

Domain PDDL:
(define (domain logistics)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types
    physobj
    object vehicle - physobj
    truck airplane - vehicle
    location - physobj
    airport - location
    city
  )
  (:predicates
    (loc ?l - location ?c - city)
    (at ?x - physobj ?l - location)
    (in ?p - object ?v - vehicle)
  )

  (:action load
    :parameters (?o - object ?v - vehicle ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?v ?l) (at ?o ?l))
    :effect (and (in ?o ?v) (not (at ?o ?l)))
  )

  (:action unload
    :parameters (?o - object ?v - vehicle ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (in ?o ?v) (at ?v ?l))
    :effect (and (at ?o ?l) (not (in ?o ?v)))
  )

  (:action drive
    :parameters (?t - truck ?from - location ?to - location ?c - city)
    :precondition (and (at ?t ?from) (loc ?from ?c) (loc ?to ?c))
    :effect (and (at ?t ?to) (not (at ?t ?from)))
  )

  (:action fly
    :parameters (?p - airplane ?from - airport ?to - airport)
    :precondition (at ?p ?from)
    :effect (and (at ?p ?to) (not (at ?p ?from)))

Problem description:
Initial State:
Two packages, a truck, and an airplane are all at the starting airport in one city.

Goal State:
Both packages are delivered to the destination airport in another city.
