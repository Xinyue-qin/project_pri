Given a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem natural language description, come up with the plan associated with the problem. The domain describes the possible actions and their effects, while the problem description details the specific scenario to be solved. Do not generate anything but the correct plan.

Domain PDDL:
(define (domain logistics)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types
    physobj
    object vehicle - physobj
    truck airplane - vehicle
    location - physobj
    airport - location
    city
  )
  (:predicates
    (loc ?l - location ?c - city)
    (at ?x - physobj ?l - location)
    (in ?p - object ?v - vehicle)
  )

  (:action load
    :parameters (?o - object ?v - vehicle ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?v ?l) (at ?o ?l))
    :effect (and (in ?o ?v) (not (at ?o ?l)))
  )

  (:action unload
    :parameters (?o - object ?v - vehicle ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (in ?o ?v) (at ?v ?l))
    :effect (and (at ?o ?l) (not (in ?o ?v)))
  )

  (:action drive
    :parameters (?t - truck ?from - location ?to - location ?c - city)
    :precondition (and (at ?t ?from) (loc ?from ?c) (loc ?to ?c))
    :effect (and (at ?t ?to) (not (at ?t ?from)))
  )

  (:action fly
    :parameters (?p - airplane ?from - airport ?to - airport)
    :precondition (at ?p ?from)
    :effect (and (at ?p ?to) (not (at ?p ?from)))
  )
)

Problem description:
Initial State:
Packages are located in different cities, with transportation vehicles positioned at strategic locations across three cities.

Goal State:
Packages need cross-city delivery, with one package going to a third city and another returning to the second city.

Plan:
