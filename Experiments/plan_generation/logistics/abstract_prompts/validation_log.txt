  Raw plan content (first 10 lines):
    To determine the plan for exchanging packages between cities in this logistics domain, we'll need more specifics about the initial state and goal state. However, since no specific locations or objects are provided, I can outline a general approach based on typical scenarios:
    1. **Load Packages onto Vehicles**:
    - Load Package1 onto Truck1 at LocationA (if it's in City1)
    - Load Package2 onto Truck2 at LocationB (if it's in City2)
    2. **Transport Packages within the Same City**:
    - Drive Truck1 from LocationA to Airport1
    - Drive Truck2 from LocationB to Airport2
    3. **Load Packages onto Airplanes**:
    - Unload Package1 from Truck1 at Airport1 and load it onto Airplane1
    - Unload Package2 from Truck2 at Airport2 and load it onto Airplane2

  Raw plan content (first 10 lines):
    To provide you with the correct plan for this PDDL problem, I'll need more specific details about the initial state (including which packages are in which cities, where each vehicle is located, etc.) as well as the exact goal state. The domain provides the possible actions and their effects, but without knowing the specifics of the scenario, it's not possible to generate a plan.
    Could you please provide:
    1. Initial positions of all objects (packages) and vehicles
    2. The specific goal condition for each package
    For example:
    Initial State:
    - Package p1 is at location l1 in city c1
    - Package p2 is at location l2 in city c2
    - Truck t1 is at location l3 in city c3
    - Airplane a1 is at airport ap1 in city c1
