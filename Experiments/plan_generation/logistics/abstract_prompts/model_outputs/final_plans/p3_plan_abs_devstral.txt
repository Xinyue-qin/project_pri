To determine the plan for exchanging packages between cities in this logistics domain, we'll need more specifics about the initial state and goal state. However, since no specific locations or objects are provided, I can outline a general approach based on typical scenarios:
1. **Load Packages onto Vehicles**:
- Load Package1 onto Truck1 at LocationA (if it's in City1)
- Load Package2 onto Truck2 at LocationB (if it's in City2)
2. **Transport Packages within the Same City**:
- Drive Truck1 from LocationA to Airport1
- Drive Truck2 from LocationB to Airport2
3. **Load Packages onto Airplanes**:
- Unload Package1 from Truck1 at Airport1 and load it onto Airplane1
- Unload Package2 from Truck2 at Airport2 and load it onto Airplane2
4. **Fly the Packages Between Cities**:
- Fly Airplane1 from Airport1 to Airport2 (City2)
- Fly Airplane2 from Airport2 to Airport1 (City1)
5. **Unload Packages from Airplanes**:
- Unload Package1 from Airplane1 at Airport2
- Unload Package2 from Airplane2 at Airport1
6. **Transport Packages within the Destination City**:
- Load Package1 onto Truck3 at Airport2 and drive to DestinationC in City2
- Load Package2 onto Truck4 at Airport1 and drive to DestinationD in City1
7. **Unload Packages at Final Destinations**:
- Unload Package1 from Truck3 at DestinationC
- Unload Package2 from Truck4 at DestinationD
