Based on the domain PDDL provided, here is the plan:
1. Load package 1 onto the truck.
2. Load package 2 onto the truck.
3. Unload package 1 at the destination airport.
4. Unload package 2 at the destination airport.
In more detail:
(load p1 t a1)
(unload p1 t a2)
The plan steps are:
1. Load package p1 onto vehicle v (truck) at location l (airport in city 1).
2. Drive truck from starting airport to destination airport.
3. Unload package p1 from truck at destination airport.
(load p2 t a1)
(fly ap a1 a2)
The plan steps are:
1. Load package p2 onto vehicle v (truck) at location l (airport in city 1).
2. Fly airplane from starting airport to destination airport.
3. Unload package p2 from truck at destination airport.
Plan:
1. (LOAD PACKAGE_1 TRUCK AIRPORT_CITY_1)
2. (DRIVE TRUCK AIRPORT_CITY_1 AIRPORT_CITY_2 CITY_1)
3. (UNLOAD PACKAGE_1 TRUCK AIRPORT_CITY_2)
4. (LOAD PACKAGE_2 AIRPLANE AIRPORT_CITY_1)
5. (FLY AIRPLANE AIRPORT_CITY_1 AIRPORT_CITY_2)
6. (UNLOAD PACKAGE_2 AIRPLANE AIRPORT_CITY_2)
