Here's how we can do it:
1. **Load the package onto the truck** at the current location.
2. **Drive the truck** (with the package) to the goal location.
3. **Unload the package** from the truck at the goal location.
Given that both locations are within the same city, and assuming we have an airport nearby or as part of our model, here's a step-by-step plan:
Plan:
1. `(load ?o - object ?v - vehicle ?l - location)`
2. `(drive ?t - truck ?from - location ?to - location ?c - city)`
3. `(unload ?o - object ?v - vehicle ?goal_location)`
Let's break it down more concretely with specific variables:
- `?o` is the package
- `?v` is the truck
- `?l` is the initial location (let's call it "city1-location")
- `?from` is the same as `?l`
- `?to` is the goal location (let's call it "city1-goal_location")
- `?c` is the city that contains both locations
Plan:
1. `(load package truck city1-location)`
2. `(drive truck city1-location city1-goal_location city1)`
3. `(unload package truck city1-goal_location)`
This plan should effectively move the package from its initial location to the goal location within the same city.
