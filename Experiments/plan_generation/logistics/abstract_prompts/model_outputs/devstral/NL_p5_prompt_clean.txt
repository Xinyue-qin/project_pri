1. The types of objects and locations available
2. Initial state - which packages are at which locations and which vehicles are at which locations
3. Goal state - where each package should be
However, without specific initial and goal states provided in this problem description, we cannot generate a precise plan.
Let's assume hypothetical scenarios to illustrate potential plans:
### Hypothetical Scenario 1:
Initial State:
- Packages: pkg1, pkg2, pkg3
- Vehicles: truck1 (at City1), airplane1 (at AirportA)
- Locations: City1, City2, City3 connected within a city. Airports: AirportA in City1, AirportB in City2.
Goal State:
- pkg1 at City2
- pkg2 at City3
- pkg3 at City1
### Plan 1:
```
1. (fly airplane1 AirportA AirportB)
2. (load pkg1 truck1 City1)
3. (drive truck1 City1 City2)
4. (unload pkg1 truck1 City2)
5. (load pkg2 truck1 City2)
6. (drive truck1 City2 City3)
7. (unload pkg2 truck1 City3)
8. (load pkg3 truck1 City3)
9. (drive truck1 City3 City1)
10. (unload pkg3 truck1 City1)
```
### Hypothetical Scenario 2:
Initial State:
- Packages: pkg1, pkg2, pkg3
- Vehicles: truck1 (at City1), airplane1 (at AirportA in City1)
- Locations: City1, City2, City3 connected within a city. Airports: AirportA in City1, AirportB in City2, AirportC in City3.
Goal State:
- pkg1 at City3
- pkg2 at City1
- pkg3 at City2
### Plan 2:
```
1. (fly airplane1 AirportA AirportB)
2. (load pkg1 truck1 City1)
3. (drive truck1 City1 City2)
4. (unload pkg1 truck1 City2)
5. (load pkg2 truck1 City2)
6. (drive truck1 City2 City3)
7. (unload pkg2 truck1 City3)
8. (fly airplane1 AirportB AirportC)
9. (load pkg3 airplane1 AirportC)
10. (fly airplane1 AirportC AirportA)
11. (unload pkg3 airplane1 AirportA)
```
