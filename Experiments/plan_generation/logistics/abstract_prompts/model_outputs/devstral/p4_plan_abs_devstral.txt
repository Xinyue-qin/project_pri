The domain provides the possible actions and their effects, but without knowing the specifics of the scenario, it's not possible to generate a plan.
Could you please provide:
1. Initial positions of all objects (packages) and vehicles
2. The specific goal condition for each package
For example:
Initial State:
- Package p1 is at location l1 in city c1
- Package p2 is at location l2 in city c2
- Truck t1 is at location l3 in city c3
- Airplane a1 is at airport ap1 in city c1
Goal State:
- Package p1 should be at location l4 in city c2
- Package p2 should be at location l5 in city c3
