Given a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem natural language description, come up with the plan associated with the problem. The domain describes the possible actions and their effects, while the problem description details the specific scenario to be solved. Do not generate anything but the correct plan.

Domain PDDL:
(define (domain hiking)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)  ; 
  (:types 
    hiker 
    location
  )
  
  (:predicates 
    (at ?h - hiker ?l - location)
    (rained ?l - location)
    (has-energy ?h - hiker)
    (path-clear ?from ?to - location)
  )

  (:action walk
    :parameters (?h - hiker ?from ?to - location)
    :precondition (and 
      (at ?h ?from)
      (path-clear ?from ?to)
      (not (rained ?to)))
    :effect (and 
      (not (at ?h ?from))
      (at ?h ?to))
  )

  (:action rest
    :parameters (?h - hiker ?l - location)
    :effect (has-energy ?h)
  )

  (:action check-weather
    :parameters (?l - location)
    :effect (not (rained ?l))  ; 
  )
)

Problem description:
Initial State:
A hiker has multiple route options to reach destination D, with a preference for one route that avoids rainy conditions.

Goal State:
The hiker reaches destination D, possibly choosing between alternative paths.
