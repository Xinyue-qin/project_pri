Based on the problem description:
1. Initial State:
- (at ?h beginning)
- (not (has-energy ?h))
2. Goal State:
- (at ?h end)
Given this setup, let's create a step-by-step plan using the defined domain actions.
Plan Steps:
1. Rest at the starting location to gain energy.
```
rest(hiker, beginning)
```
2. Check if it rained along the path.
```
check-weather(end)
```
3. Walk from the beginning to the end of the trail (assuming `path-clear` is true).
```
walk(hiker, beginning, end)
```
Therefore, the plan would be:
```
rest(hiker, beginning)
check-weather(end)
walk(hiker, beginning, end)
```
