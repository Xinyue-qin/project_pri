1. Initial State:
- The hiker is tired (implies needs energy)
- There is a dangerous section that is currently rainy
2. Goal State:
- The hiker successfully reaches the summit
3. Actions:
- `walk`: Moves from one location to another if there's a clear path and no rain
- `rest`: Gives energy to the hiker
- `check-weather`: Clears the rainy condition for a location
Given this, we can derive the plan:
1. Rest at the current location to gain energy (since the hiker is tired).
2. Check weather conditions on the dangerous section.
3. Walk from the current location to the summit (assuming "summit" is a valid destination and there's a path from the starting point).
Plan:
```
(rest ?h ?current_location)
(check-weather ?dangerous_section)
(walk ?h ?current_location ?summit)
```
