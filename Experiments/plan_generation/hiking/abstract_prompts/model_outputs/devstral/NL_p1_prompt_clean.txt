### Initial State
- A hiker starts at the base with energy.
- There is a clear path through a camp to the summit.
### Goal State
- The hiker reaches the summit.
### Available Actions
1. **walk**
- Preconditions: `at ?h ?from`, `path-clear ?from ?to`, `not (rained ?to)`
- Effects: Move from location `?from` to location `?to`
2. **rest**
- Preconditions: None specified for this action in the given PDDL
- Effect: `has-energy ?h`
3. **check-weather**
- Preconditions: None specified for this action in the given PDDL
- Effects: Check if it's not raining at location `?l` (removes `(rained ?l)`)
### Plan Construction
1. The hiker starts at the base and needs to move through the camp to reach the summit.
2. First, we need to ensure there is no rain at both the camp and the summit before walking from the base to the camp and then from the camp to the summit.
Thus, the plan would be:
1. **check-weather** at Camp
2. **walk** from Base to Camp
3. **check-weather** at Summit
4. **walk** from Camp to Summit
So, the correct plan is:
```
(check-weather camp)
(walk hiker base camp)
(check-weather summit)
(walk hiker camp summit)
```
