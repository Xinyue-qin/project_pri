1. (rest ?h - hiker ?lodge - location)  ; Recharge energy at lodge
2. (check-weather ?trail - location)    ; Check if trail is clear from rain
3. (walk ?h - hiker ?lodge - location ?trail - location)
4. (walk ?h - hiker ?trail - location ?peak - location)
This plan ensures the hiker has energy, checks for and clears any weather issues on the trail, then walks from the lodge to the peak via the trail.
