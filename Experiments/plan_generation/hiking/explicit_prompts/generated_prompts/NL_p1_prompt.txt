Given a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem natural language description, come up with the plan associated with the problem. The domain describes the possible actions and their effects, while the problem description details the specific scenario to be solved. Do not generate anything but the correct plan.

Domain PDDL:
(define (domain hiking)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)  ; 
  (:types 
    hiker 
    location
  )
  
  (:predicates 
    (at ?h - hiker ?l - location)
    (rained ?l - location)
    (has-energy ?h - hiker)
    (path-clear ?from ?to - location)
  )

  (:action walk
    :parameters (?h - hiker ?from ?to - location)
    :precondition (and 
      (at ?h ?from)
      (path-clear ?from ?to)
      (not (rained ?to)))
    :effect (and 
      (not (at ?h ?from))
      (at ?h ?to))
  )

  (:action rest
    :parameters (?h - hiker ?l - location)
    :effect (has-energy ?h)
  )

  (:action check-weather
    :parameters (?l - location)
    :effect (not (rained ?l))  ; 
  )
)

Problem description:
Hiker h1 is at base. Paths are clear from base to camp and from camp to summit. Hiker h1 has energy.

Goal State:
Hiker h1 is at summit.
