Let's analyze the steps required based on the domain and problem description:
1. **Initial State:**
- Hiker h1 is at base.
- Paths are clear: (base, camp) and (camp, summit).
- Hiker h1 has energy.
2. **Goal State:**
- Hiker h1 is at summit.
3. **Available Actions:**
- `walk(?h, ?from, ?to)`: Move from one location to another if the path is clear.
- `rest(?h, ?l)`: Gain energy at a location.
- `check-weather(?l)`: Ensure it hasn't rained at a location.
Since we know that paths are already clear and the hiker has energy, we don't need to use `check-weather` or `rest`. We just need to plan the sequence of walks:
1. Walk from base to camp.
2. Walk from camp to summit.
The generated plan is:
```pddl
( walk h1 base camp )
( walk h1 camp summit )
```
So, the correct plan to achieve the goal state is:
```
(walk h1 base camp)
(walk h1 camp summit)
```
