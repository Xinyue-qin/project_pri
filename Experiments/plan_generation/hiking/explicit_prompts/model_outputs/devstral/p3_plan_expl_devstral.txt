### Initial State:
- `at h1 start`
- `path-clear start mid`
- `path-clear mid end`
- `(not (has-energy h1))`
### Goal State:
- `at h1 end`
Here's a step-by-step plan to achieve the goal:
1. **Rest**: Hiker needs to regain energy.
- Action: rest(h1, start)
- Effect: (has-energy h1)
2. **Walk from Start to Mid**:
- Preconditions:
- `at h1 start` (true by initial state)
- `path-clear start mid` (true by initial state)
- `(not (rained mid))` (assumed true since no rain is mentioned)
- Action: walk(h1, start, mid)
- Effect:
- (not (at h1 start))
- at h1 mid
3. **Check Weather at End Location**:
- Action: check-weather(end)
- Effect: (not (rained end))
4. **Walk from Mid to End**:
- Preconditions:
- `at h1 mid` (true after previous walk action)
- `path-clear mid end` (true by initial state)
- `(not (rained end))` (made true by check-weather action)
- Action: walk(h1, mid, end)
- Effect:
- (not (at h1 mid))
- at h1 end
### Plan
```
rest(h1, start)
walk(h1, start, mid)
check-weather(end)
walk(h1, mid, end)
```
