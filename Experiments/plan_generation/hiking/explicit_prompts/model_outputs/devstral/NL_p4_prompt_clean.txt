### Initial State
- (at h1 A)
- Paths: A→B→D and A→C→D
### Goal State
- (at h1 D)
We need a plan that gets Hiker h1 from location A to location D.
Given that there is a preference that Location C has not rained, we'll plan the path through B instead of C. Here's the step-by-step plan:
1. **Check Weather at B** - If it rains at B, then clear the rain before walking.
2. **Walk from A to B**
3. **Check Weather at D** - If it rains at D, then clear the rain before reaching D.
4. **Walk from B to D**
The plan would be:
```
(check-weather B)
(walk h1 A B)
(check-weather D)
(walk h1 B D)
```
This plan ensures that Hiker h1 reaches location D by avoiding potential rain at locations B and D.
