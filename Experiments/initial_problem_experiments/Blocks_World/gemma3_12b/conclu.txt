Based on the analysis of the five log files generated by Fast Downward when processing the Gemma3:12b-repaired PDDL problem files for the Blocksworld domain, here is a comprehensive assessment of the model's capability to complete missing initial states:

Overall Assessment of Gemma3:12b's PDDL Generation Capability
Success Rate: 1/5 (20%) - Only one of the five generated problem files resulted in a solvable planning task.

Detailed File-by-File Analysis
p1_by_LLMs.pddl ✅ Successfully Compiled and Solved
Translation: Successful (exit code: 0) with 53 relevant atoms, 33 auxiliary atoms

Search Result: Solution found! with a valid 4-step plan

Plan: pickup b, stack b c, pickup a, stack a b (cost: 4)

Assessment: Excellent performance. The model successfully repaired the initial state, providing all necessary predicates to make the task solvable. The generated plan is logically correct and follows proper Blocksworld semantics, though not optimal (cost 4 vs possible cost 3 in some configurations).

p2_by_LLMs.pddl ❌ Compilation Failed
Error: Undefined object: none in init block element #5

Assessment: Syntax failure. The model introduced an undefined object "none" in the initial state, showing poor understanding of PDDL object declaration requirements.

p3_by_LLMs.pddl ❌ Compilation Failed
Error: Missing ')' - Syntax error

Assessment: Basic formatting failure. The model failed to produce properly formatted PDDL with balanced parentheses, indicating inconsistent attention to syntax details.

p4_by_LLMs.pddl ❌ Compilation Failed
Error: Missing ')' - Syntax error

Assessment: Repeated syntax failure. Same error as p3, showing consistent pattern of basic formatting issues across multiple outputs.

p5_by_LLMs.pddl ⚠️ Compiled but Unsolvable
Translation: Successful (exit code: 0) with 85 relevant atoms

Search Result: Initial state is a dead end → No solution!

Assessment: The file compiled successfully but the initial state provided by the model was a dead end. Despite the large state space (85 relevant atoms), no path to goals exists from the provided initial state.

Key Findings and Capability Assessment
Strengths (Demonstrated in p1):
Semantic Understanding: In the successful case, the model demonstrated excellent understanding of Blocksworld mechanics and provided exactly the missing initial predicates needed for solvability.

Plan Generation: The 4-step plan for p1 is logically correct and achieves the goals through proper action sequencing.

Complexity Handling: The model handled relatively complex state spaces (53+ relevant atoms) successfully in the working case.

Weaknesses (Evident in p2-p5):
Inconsistent Syntax: 60% of outputs (3/5) failed basic PDDL syntax checking, showing significant variability in output quality.

Object Management: Introduction of undefined objects ("none") reveals poor understanding of PDDL's object declaration system.

Parenthesis Errors: Repeated missing parenthesis errors indicate careless formatting in most outputs.

Semantic Gaps: Even when syntax was correct (p5), the model provided initial states that were logically dead ends.

Performance Patterns:
Syntax Success Rate: 40% (2/5 files compiled)

Semantic Success Rate: 50% of compiled files were actually solvable (1/2)

Overall Success Rate: 20% (1/5 files fully functional)

Comparative Analysis with Smaller Gemma Variants:
Gemma3:12b shows worse performance than smaller 4b variant in:

Syntax Accuracy: 40% vs 100% compilation success rate

Consistency: Higher variability in output quality

Basic Competence: More fundamental syntax errors

However, it maintains similar:

Semantic Capability: When it works, the solutions are correct

Planning Understanding: Good grasp of Blocksworld dynamics in successful cases

Conclusion
Gemma3:12b demonstrates disappointing and inconsistent capabilities in repairing incomplete PDDL problem files:

Concerning Findings:

Worse syntax performance than smaller models (40% vs 100% compilation)

Introduction of undefined objects shows fundamental misunderstandings

Repeated basic formatting errors across multiple outputs

Only 20% overall success rate despite larger model size

Limited Strengths:

When syntax is correct, demonstrates good semantic understanding

Can handle complex state spaces successfully

Generates logically valid plans when the initial state is properly repaired

The results suggest that increasing model size alone does not guarantee better PDDL generation performance. The 12b variant actually performed worse than the 4b variant in basic syntax compliance, indicating that either:

Training data limitations: The larger model may have overfitted or learned poor patterns

Prompt sensitivity: The 12b model may be more sensitive to specific prompting techniques

Random variability: The results could reflect sampling variability rather than fundamental capabilities

For practical use, Gemma3:12b would be less reliable than smaller variants for PDDL generation tasks, requiring more extensive human verification and correction due to its high rate of basic syntax errors. The model shows potential for semantic understanding but needs significant improvement in consistency and attention to syntactic details.
