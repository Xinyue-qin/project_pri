To address the issue of the unsolvable problem, we need to complete the initial state with the missing predicate information that will 
make the goal achievable. Let's analyze what's given:

1. We know from the goal state:
   - `on-table C`
   - `on B C`
   - `on A B`

2. From this, we can infer the following for the initial state:
   - Since `(clear C)` is already provided in the initial state, and there's no information about `arm-empty` or `holding ?x`, we need 
to assume the arm is empty.
   - We also need to specify that blocks A and B are not on any other block, as they'll be stacked later.

Here's a plausible complete initial state:

```pddl
(define (problem tower-reversal-complete)
  (:domain blocksworld-4ops)
  (:objects A B C - block)
  (:init
    (arm-empty)           ; Arm is empty
    (on B A)
    (on C B)
    (clear C)
    (not (on-table A))    ; Not on table, because it's on B
    (not (on-table B))    ; Not on table, because it's on C
  )
  (:goal (and (on-table C) (on B C) (on A B)))
)
```

In this initial state:
- The arm is empty (`arm-empty`), which allows for the planning agent to start picking up blocks.
- We have `(not (on-table A))` and `(not (on-table B))` because they are stacked on other blocks.
- All other necessary predicates from the original problem description are maintained.

This complete initial state should make the goal achievable through proper planning actions.
