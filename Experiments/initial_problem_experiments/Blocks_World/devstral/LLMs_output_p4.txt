To make the problem solvable, we need to ensure that all blocks have clear 
predicates and proper on-table predicates specified for those not 
explicitly mentioned in the goal. Here's an alternative initial state in 
PDDL where each block is either on the table or on another block with 
clear predicates defined:

```pddl
(define (problem partial-goal)
  (:domain blocksworld-4ops)
  (:objects A B C D - block)
  (:init
    (arm-empty)
    (on-table A) (on-table B) (on-table C) (on-table D)
    (clear A) (clear B) (clear C) (clear D)
  )
  (:goal (and (on A B) (on C D)))
)
```

This initial state ensures that all blocks start on the table and are 
clear, which allows the planner to pick them up and stack them according 
to the goal.
