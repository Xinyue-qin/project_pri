Sure, let's analyze the problem and find a feasible initial state that 
allows us to achieve all the goals.

### Current Problem Setup:
- **Initial State:**
  - `(on-table A)`
  - `(on B A)`
  - `(on C B)`
  - `(clear C)`
  - `(on-table D)`

- **Goal State:**
  - `(on A C)` and `(on-table C)` (which means C should be clear)
  - `(on B E)` and `(on-table E)` (E must be on the table, and B must be 
on top of E)
  - `(on D B)`

### Analysis:
1. **C** needs to be clear and also have A on it, which is a contradiction 
because C cannot be both clear and having another block on it at the same 
time.
2. **E** is not mentioned in the initial state but must appear as part of 
the goal.

### Feasible Initial State:
We need to include E in the initial state properly positioned so that B 
can be stacked on it, and make sure C is clear initially (not holding any 
blocks).

Let's consider an alternative initial state:

- All blocks are initially on the table except for those mentioned 
explicitly.
- C is clear and not holding anything.

Here is an alternative initial state in PDDL:

```pddl
(define (problem multi-tower)
  (:domain blocksworld-4ops)
  (:objects A B C D E - block)
  (:init
    (on-table A)   ; Initially, A is on the table
    (on-table B)   ; Initially, B is on the table
    (clear C)      ; C is clear and not holding any blocks
    (on-table D)   ; Initially, D is on the table
    (on-table E)   ; Initially, E is on the table, ready for stacking
  )
  (:goal (and
          (on A C)
          (on-table C)
          (on B E)
          (on-table E)
          (on D B)))
)
```

This setup ensures:
- All blocks are initially clear or positioned correctly.
- The goal state can be achieved by stacking the blocks accordingly.
