```pddl
(define (problem tower-reversal-alt)
  (:domain blocksworld-4ops)
  (:objects A B C - block)
  (:init (on B A) (on C B)
         (clear C) (arm-empty))
  (:goal (and (on-table C) (on B C) (on A B))))
```

**Explanation of the changes and why it works:**

The original problem was unsolvable because the initial state lacked the 
`arm-empty` predicate. The `pickup` action requires an empty arm.  We've 
added `(arm-empty)` to the initial state.  This ensures the agent begins 
with an empty arm, and the `pickup` action can proceed to lift block `A` 
and place it on block `B`.  The goal remains the same: to reverse the 
tower by placing `C` on the table and `B` on `C`.
