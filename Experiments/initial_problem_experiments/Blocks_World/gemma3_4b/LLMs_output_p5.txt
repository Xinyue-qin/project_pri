```pddl
(define (problem multi-tower-alt)
  (:domain blocksworld-4ops)
  (:objects A B C D E - block)
  (:init (on-table A) (on B A) (on C B) (clear C)
         (on-table D) (clear E))
  (:goal (and (on A C) (on-table C)
              (on B E) (on-table E)
              (on A B))))
```

**Explanation of the changes and why it works:**

The original problem was unsolvable because the initial state lacked the 
`clear` predicate for block `E`. The `stack` action requires a block to be 
clear to be stacked on top of another. We've added `(clear E)` to the 
initial state. This ensures that block `E` is clear, enabling the agent to 
perform the necessary actions to achieve the specified goal. The goal 
remains the same.
