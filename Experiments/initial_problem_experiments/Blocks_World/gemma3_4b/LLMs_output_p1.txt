```pddl
(define (problem simple-stack-alt)
  (:domain blocksworld-4ops)
  (:objects A B C - block)
  (:init (on-table A) (on-table B) (on-table C)
         (clear A) (clear B) (clear C)
         (holding A)
         (arm-empty)
         )
  (:goal (and (on A B) (on B C) (on-table C))))
```

**Explanation of the changes and why it works:**

The original problem was unsolvable because the initial state lacked the 
necessary preconditions for actions like `pickup`. We've added `(holding 
A)` to the initial state.  This means the agent starts with block `A` in 
its hand, allowing it to perform the `pickup` action and then the `stack` 
action.  The initial state now includes a minimal configuration that 
enables the solution.  The goal is still the same: to stack blocks A on B 
and B on C.
