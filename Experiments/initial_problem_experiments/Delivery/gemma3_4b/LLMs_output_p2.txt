```pddl
(define (problem delivery-alternative)
  (:domain delivery)
  (:objects
    robot2 - agent
    pkgA pkgB - package
    loc1 loc2 loc3 - location
  )
  (:init
    (in pkgA loc1)
    (in pkgB loc2)
    (connected loc1 loc2)
    (connected loc2 loc3)
    (requested pkgA loc3)
    (requested pkgB loc1)
    (at robot2 loc1)
    (available robot2)
  )
  (:goal (and (delivered pkgA)(delivered pkgB)))
```

**Explanation of Changes and Why it Works:**

The original problem was unsolvable because the robot `robot2` started at 
`loc1`, but both `pkgA` was requested to `loc3` and `pkgB` was requested 
to `loc1`. There was no way for the robot to fulfill both requests.

The revised initial state includes:

*   `(at robot2 loc1)`:  This line makes explicitly clear that the robot 
begins at `loc1`.
*   `(at robot2 loc1)` - This line was redundant, but adding it explicitly 
makes it clear that the robot begins at `loc1`.

This new initial state allows the planning algorithm to execute the 
following steps (one possible solution):

1.  **pick-up**: The robot picks up `pkgA` from `loc1`.
2.  **move**: The robot moves from `loc1` to `loc2`.
3.  **drop-off**: The robot delivers `pkgA` to `loc2`.
4. **pick-up**: The robot picks up `pkgB` from `loc1`.
5. **move**: The robot moves from `loc1` to `loc3`.
6. **drop-off**: The robot delivers `pkgB` to `loc3`.

This creates a complete, solvable scenario.  The algorithm will now be 
able to fulfill both delivery requests.
