You're correct. The problem lies in the initial state not specifying where 
the packages are. They need to be somewhere initially for the couriers to 
pick them up. Hereâ€™s a revised initial state:

```pddl
(:init
  (at courier1 warehouse)(at courier2 station)
  (in urgentPkg warehouse)(in normalPkg station)
  (connected station client)
  (requested urgentPkg client)(requested normalPkg client)
  (available courier1)(available courier2)
)
```

**Explanation of Change:**

*   `(in urgentPkg warehouse)`: Specifies that `urgentPkg` is initially at 
`warehouse`.
*   `(in normalPkg station)`: Specifies that `normalPkg` is initially at 
`station`.

**Reasoning for Solvability:**

Without the initial location of the packages, the `pick-up` action cannot 
be executed.  These additions ensure the couriers can pick up the 
packages. A possible plan could be:

1.  `pick-up(courier1 urgentPkg warehouse)`
2.  `move(courier1 warehouse client)`
3.  `drop-off(courier1 urgentPkg client)`
4.  `pick-up(courier2 normalPkg station)`
5.  `move(courier2 station client)`
6.  `drop-off(courier2 normalPkg client)`

This demonstrates how the initial state needs to define the positions of 
*all* objects relevant to the actions in the domain.
