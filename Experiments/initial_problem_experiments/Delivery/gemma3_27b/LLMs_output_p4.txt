**Explanation of Changes:**

The original problem was unsolvable because the initial state didn't 
specify *where* the packages were located.  The robots can be at their 
starting locations and the connections are established, but without 
knowing the initial location of `urgentPkg` and `normalPkg`, the planner 
cannot begin a valid sequence of actions. I added `(in urgentPkg 
warehouse)` and `(in normalPkg warehouse)` to the initial state.

Now a possible plan could involve:

1.  `courier1` picks up `urgentPkg` at `warehouse`.
2.  `courier1` moves from `warehouse` to `client`.
3.  `courier1` drops off `urgentPkg` at `client`.
4.  `courier2` picks up `normalPkg` at `warehouse`.
5.  `courier2` moves from `warehouse` to `client`.
6.  `courier2` drops off `normalPkg` at `client`.

These added predicates are the minimal changes necessary to make the 
problem solvable. Without them, the planner has no basis for initiating 
the delivery process.
