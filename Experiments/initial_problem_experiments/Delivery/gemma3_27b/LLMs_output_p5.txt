```pddl
(:init
  (connected depot hospital)
  (connected hospital disasterArea)
  (requested medicalPkg disasterArea)
  (not (connected depot disasterArea))
  (available drone)
  (at drone depot)
  (in medicalPkg depot)
)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

The original problem was unsolvable because the initial state didn't specify 
*where* the drone and the package were located.  While connections and the 
request are defined, the planner cannot start the delivery process without 
knowing the initial positions. I added `(at drone depot)` and `(in medicalPkg 
depot)` to the initial state.

Now, the planner can formulate a plan:

1.  The drone picks up the package at the depot.
2.  The drone moves from the depot to the hospital.
3.  The drone moves from the hospital to the disaster area.
4.  The drone drops off the package at the disaster area.

These additions are the minimal changes needed to make the problem solvable 
without including the goal state directly. Without them, the planner has no 
starting point for the delivery process.
