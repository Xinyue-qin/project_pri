Okay, let’s craft a plausible initial state that allows us to achieve the 
goal of `(delivered pkgX)` while remaining consistent with the provided 
domain and predicates.

```pddl
(define (problem delivery-relay)
  (:domain delivery)
  (:objects
    robotA robotB - agent
    pkgX - package
    locX locY locZ - location
  )
  (:init
    (at robotA locX)(at robotB locZ)
    (in pkgX locX)
    (connected locX locY)(connected locY locZ)
    (requested pkgX locZ)
  )
  (:goal (delivered pkgX))
)
```

**Reasoning for this alternative:**

* **Focus on Initial State:** This initial state focuses on the robot's 
location and connection to another robot, directly establishing the 
prerequisites for the goal.
* **Connectedness:** The `connected` predicates ensure the locations are 
accessible.
* **Request:** The `requested` predicates now clearly state the desired 
action – to deliver the package (`pkgX`).

This initial state is a logical step:  The robot *must* be at the location 
of the package to perform the action of delivery.  It's a good starting 
point for a planning task where the goal is simply to deliver a package.
