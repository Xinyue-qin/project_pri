Certainly! To make the planning task solvable, we need to add information 
about where the drone and package initially are located.

Here's a revised version of the problem with an appropriate initial state:

```pddl
(define (problem delivery-dynamic)
(:domain delivery)
(:objects
  drone - agent
  medicalPkg - package
  hospital depot disasterArea - location
)
(:init
  (at drone depot) ; Drone starts at the depot
  (in medicalPkg depot) ; Package starts at the depot
  (connected depot hospital)
  (connected hospital disasterArea)
  (requested medicalPkg disasterArea)
  (not (connected depot disasterArea)) ; Must go through hospital
  (available drone)
)
(:goal (delivered medicalPkg))
)
```

In this version, we've specified that the `drone` is at the `depot` and 
the `medicalPkg` is also in the `depot`. This provides a complete initial 
state from which the planner can achieve the goal of delivering the 
package to the `disasterArea`.
