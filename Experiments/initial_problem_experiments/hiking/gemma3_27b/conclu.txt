Based on the provided log files and plan outputs, here is an analysis of Gemma3:27B's capability to complete PDDL problem files with missing initial states for the hiking domain:

Overall Assessment
Gemma3:27B demonstrates strong capability in completing missing initial states for PDDL problem files. The model successfully generated syntactically valid and semantically meaningful initial states in 4 out of 5 cases (p1, p2, p3, p5), leading to successful and optimal plans. However, it failed in 1 case (p4) due to a critical structural error in the problem file.

Detailed Analysis
1. Successful Cases (p1, p2, p3, p5)
p1_by_LLMs.pddl:

Translation & Search: Successful (exit code 0).

Plan: Single step (walk h1 camp summit) with cost 1.

Interpretation: The model correctly inferred the initial state (at h1 camp) and goal (at h1 summit), and the plan is valid and direct.

p2_by_LLMs.pddl:

Translation & Search: Successful (exit code 0).

Plan: Two steps: (walk h1 lodge trail) and (walk h1 trail peak) with cost 2.

Interpretation: The model correctly added initial state (at h1 lodge) and goal (at h1 peak), and the plan is optimal.

p3_by_LLMs.pddl:

Translation & Search: Successful (exit code 0).

Plan: Two steps: (walk h1 start mid) and (walk h1 mid end) with cost 2.

Interpretation: The model correctly added initial state (at h1 start) and goal (at h1 end), and the plan is valid.

p5_by_LLMs.pddl:

Translation & Search: Successful (exit code 0).

Plan: Three steps: (walk h1 base rest-area), (walk h1 rest-area danger-zone), (walk h1 danger-zone summit) with cost 3.

Interpretation: The model correctly added initial state (at h1 base) and goal (at h1 summit), and the plan is optimal.

Strengths in Successful Cases:

The model consistently understood the hiking domain semantics (e.g., the walk operator requires consecutive locations).

It generated initial states that are consistent with the goal and domain constraints.

All plans produced are optimal (minimum cost) for the given paths.

The model handled varied location names (e.g., camp, summit, lodge, trail, start, mid, end, base, rest-area, danger-zone) without issues, showing robustness in variable naming.

2. Failed Case (p4)
p4_by_LLMs.pddl:

Failure Reason: Structural error â€“ the problem file lacked required fields.

Error: The problem file must contain at least the following five fields: define-keyword, problem name, domain name, initial state, and goal.

Interpretation: The model likely omitted a critical section (e.g., the (:domain ...) declaration or the (:init ...) block) or misstructured the file. This indicates a lapse in adhering to PDDL's strict formatting requirements.

Weakness in Failed Case:

The model occasionally fails to generate a fully compliant PDDL structure, missing mandatory fields. This is a syntax issue rather than a semantic one.

Key Observations
Semantic Understanding: The model excels in inferring missing initial states logically. It correctly identifies the starting location based on the goal and the connectivity of locations in the domain.

Syntax Proficiency: In most cases (4/5), the model produced syntactically correct PDDL. The single failure (p4) was due to a missing structural element, not a predicate-level error.

Optimal Planning: All generated plans are optimal, with costs matching the minimum number of steps required. This indicates that the model's initial states are well-chosen and consistent with the domain's dynamics.

Generalization: The model worked flawlessly with diverse location sets, demonstrating strong generalization across different problem instances.

Comparison with Gemma3:12B
Success Rate: Gemma3:27B achieved 80% success (4/5), while Gemma3:12B had 60% (3/5).

Error Types: Gemma3:27B's only error was structural (missing field), whereas Gemma3:12B made both structural and predicate-level errors (e.g., arity mismatch).

Robustness: Gemma3:27B showed better consistency in syntax and semantic accuracy.

Recommendations for Improvement
Explicit Prompting: Remind the model to include all mandatory PDDL sections (:domain, :init, :goal, etc.) in the prompt.

Post-generation Validation: Use a lightweight syntax checker before passing the problem to the planner to catch missing fields.

Fine-tuning: Further fine-tuning on PDDL problem files could eliminate rare structural errors.

Conclusion
Gemma3:27B demonstrates high proficiency in completing PDDL problem files with missing initial states. It shows strong semantic understanding of the hiking domain, generates optimal plans, and handles varied location names robustly. The single failure in p4 was due to a structural oversight, which is less critical than predicate-level errors and easier to address. With minor improvements in ensuring structural completeness, Gemma3:27B can be a reliable tool for automated PDDL problem generation and completion. Its performance is superior to Gemma3:12B, indicating that larger model size contributes to better accuracy and reliability in this task.
