To make the problem solvable, we need to ensure that all preconditions for 
actions leading towards the goal are met and address any potential issues with 
rain.

The current problem states:
- H1 starts at the lodge.
- Paths are clear from lodge to trail and trail to peak.
- H1 has energy.

However, there's no initial condition addressing whether it has rained at each 
location. Since the domain allows for checking weather conditions using 
`check-weather`, we need to ensure that the hiker can reach the goal without rain 
preventing movement.

Hereâ€™s an alternative initial state in PDDL that makes the goal achievable:

```pddl
(define (problem hike-weather)
  (:domain hiking)
  (:objects
    h1 - hiker
    lodge trail peak - location)
  (:init
    ; H1 starts at the lodge
    (at h1 lodge)

    ; Paths are clear
    (path-clear lodge trail)
    (path-clear trail peak)

    ; No rain at starting points, can be verified later if needed
    (not (rained lodge))
    (not (rained trail))

    ; H1 has energy
    (has-energy h1)
  )
  (:goal (at h1 peak))
)
```

In this modified problem:
- H1 starts at the lodge.
- Paths are clear from lodge to trail and trail to peak.
- No rain is initially assumed at the starting points, which can be verified 
later using `check-weather` if necessary.
- H1 has energy.

This should make the planning task solvable as it satisfies all necessary 
preconditions for actions in the domain and addresses potential issues with rain.
