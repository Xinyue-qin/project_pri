To make the problem solvable, we need to ensure that all preconditions for 
actions leading towards the goal are met and address any potential issues with 
energy and paths.

The current problem states:
- H1 starts at `start`.
- Path is clear from `start` to `mid`.

However, there's no initial condition addressing whether it has rained at each 
location or if the path from `mid` to `end` is clear. Additionally, we need to 
ensure that the hiker has energy to perform actions.

Hereâ€™s an alternative initial state in PDDL that makes the goal achievable:

```pddl
(define (problem hike-energy)
  (:domain hiking)
  (:objects
    h1 - hiker
    start mid end - location)
  (:init
    ; H1 starts at start location
    (at h1 start)

    ; Paths are clear
    (path-clear start mid)
    (path-clear mid end)

    ; No rain initially assumed for simplicity, can be verified later if needed
    (not (rained start))
    (not (rained mid))
    (not (rained end))

    ; H1 has energy to perform actions
    (has-energy h1)
  )
  (:goal (at h1 end))
)
```

In this modified problem:
- H1 starts at the `start` location.
- Paths are clear from `start` to `mid` and from `mid` to `end`.
- No rain is initially assumed at all locations, which can be verified later 
using `check-weather` if necessary.
- H1 has energy.

This should make the planning task solvable as it satisfies all necessary 
preconditions for actions in the domain.
