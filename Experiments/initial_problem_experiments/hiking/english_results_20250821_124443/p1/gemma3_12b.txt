========================================

Okay, you've correctly identified the problem. The initial state is incomplete because it doesn't specify where the hiker `h1` starts. Without knowing the initial location of the hiker, the planner cannot establish a valid path.  The `check-weather` action also seems strange since there is no initial rain conditions described.

Here's an alternative initial state that provides sufficient information to solve the problem, avoiding directly specifying the goal state:

```pddl
(define (problem hike-easy)
  (:domain hiking)
  (:objects
    h1 - hiker
    base camp summit - location)
  (:init
    (at h1 base camp)  ; Hiker starts at the base camp
    (path-clear base camp summit) ; Clear path from base camp to summit
    (has-energy h1)
  )
  (:goal (at h1 summit))
)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **`(at h1 base camp)`**:  This is the critical addition. It explicitly states that the hiker `h1` begins at the `base camp`. This allows the planner to start from a known location.

**Why this works and is an appropriate fix:**

*   **Completeness:** It addresses the missing information about the hiker's initial location.
*   **Solvability:**  With this initial state, the planner can now reason about possible actions: the hiker can use the `walk` action to move from the `base camp` to the `summit`.
*   **Minimal Change:** It only adds the necessary information to enable planning; it doesn't drastically alter the problem's setup or introduce unnecessary complexity.
*   **Doesn't violate the "no directly specifying goals" constraint:** The initial state does not describe the goal state. It only sets up the starting conditions.

This modified initial state provides the planner with the information it needs to find a solution, allowing it to sequence the `walk` action to achieve the goal of having the hiker `h1` at the `summit`.
