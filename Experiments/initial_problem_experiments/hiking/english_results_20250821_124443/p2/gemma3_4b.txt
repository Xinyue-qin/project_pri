```pddl
(define (problem hike-weather-revised)
  (:domain hiking)
  (:objects
    h1 - hiker
    lodge trail peak - location)
  (:init
    (at h1 lodge)
    (path-clear lodge trail)
    (path-clear trail peak)
    (has-energy h1)
    (not (rained lodge))
    (not (rained trail))
  )
  (:goal (at h1 peak))
)
```

**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning:**

The original problem was unsolvable because the initial state didn't provide information about the weather at the locations.  The planner needs to know whether it's raining at each location to correctly execute the `walk` action, which has the precondition `(not (rained ?to))`.

The revised initial state addresses this by adding the following predicates:

*   `(not (rained lodge))`  - Indicates the weather is *not* raining at the lodge.
*   `(not (rained trail))` - Indicates the weather is *not* raining at the trail.

These additions ensure that the `walk` action can be performed from the lodge to the trail without violating its precondition.  The planner can now correctly sequence actions to reach the peak.  The `check-weather` action is unnecessary as it's implicitly guaranteed by the initial state that weather is not raining at each location.
