Okay, you are right. The problem is unsolvable as given. The `check-weather` action is never used, and without knowing if it has rained at the goal location (`peak`), the plan cannot reliably reach the goal.  The initial state needs to explicitly indicate that it is *not* raining at the peak location so the `walk` action can be applied.

Here's an alternative initial state that fixes this issue, while still allowing a solution that isn't trivial (doesn't just directly assert the goal):

```pddl
(:init
    (at h1 lodge)
    (path-clear lodge trail)
    (path-clear trail peak)
    (has-energy h1)
    (not (rained peak))  ; Crucially, we state it's not raining at the peak initially
)
```

**Explanation of the Change:**

*   **`(not (rained peak))`**: This line is the key. It adds to the initial state that it is *not* raining at the `peak` location. This allows the `walk` action to be used to move from `trail` to `peak` without failing the precondition `(not (rained ?to))`.

With this modified initial state, the planner can create a simple plan like this:

1.  Walk from lodge to trail.
2.  Walk from trail to peak.

This achieves the goal `(at h1 peak)`.  The initial state does not directly assert the goal; it just provides the necessary condition for the planner to reach it using the defined actions.
