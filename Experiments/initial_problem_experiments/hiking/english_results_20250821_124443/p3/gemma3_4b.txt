========================================

Here's an alternative initial state in PDDL that allows the `hike-energy` problem to be solved, without explicitly stating the goal:

```pddl
(define (problem hike-energy-revised)
  (:domain hiking)
  (:objects 
    h1 - hiker
    start mid end - location)
  (:init
    (at h1 start)
    (path-clear start mid)
    (not (rained mid)) ; Explicitly stating the weather is not rained at mid
  )
```

**Explanation of Changes and Why It Works:**

The original problem's unsolvability stemmed from the lack of information about the weather. The planner couldn't determine if it was raining or not, which was a crucial factor for `walk` action.

The revised initial state includes `(not (rained mid))`. This explicitly states that the weather at `mid` location is *not* raining.  This removes the ambiguity and allows the planner to correctly use the `walk` action.  The `walk` action requires `(not (rained ?to))` as a precondition.

This revised initial state provides the necessary information for the planner to successfully reach the goal of having `h1` at `end`.  The planner can now apply the `walk` action from `start` to `mid` and then from `mid` to `end`.
