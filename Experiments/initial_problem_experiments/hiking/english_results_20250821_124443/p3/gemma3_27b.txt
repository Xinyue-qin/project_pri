Okay, you're right. The provided initial state is incomplete. To reach the goal of `(at h1 end)`, we need to know if there's a path from `mid` to `end`, and also that the hiker has energy. Also, it needs to not have rained at all locations. Here's an expanded initial state that makes the problem solvable, without *directly* stating the goal:

```pddl
(define (problem hike-energy)
  (:domain hiking)
  (:objects
    h1 - hiker
    start mid end - location)
  (:init
    (at h1 start)
    (path-clear start mid)
    (path-clear mid end)
    (has-energy h1)
    (not (rained start))
    (not (rained mid))
    (not (rained end))
  )
  (:goal (at h1 end)))
```

**Explanation of changes:**

*   **`(path-clear mid end)`:**  This predicate establishes that a clear path exists from the middle location (`mid`) to the end location (`end`).  Without this, the planner wouldn't be able to consider walking from `mid` to `end`.
*   **`(has-energy h1)`:**  The hiker needs energy to be able to reach the goal.
*   **`(not (rained start))` , `(not (rained mid))`, `(not (rained end))`:** To be able to walk between locations, it needs to not have rained.

With this extended initial state, a planner should be able to find a plan involving walking from `start` to `mid`, then from `mid` to `end`, achieving the goal.  Critically, we haven't *directly* stated `(at h1 end)` in the initial state, only provided the conditions necessary for it to be achieved.
