Okay, you're right. The original initial state is insufficient. The problem description includes a `prefer` predicate which isn't defined in the domain, and more importantly, there's no way to achieve the goal because we don't know if paths are clear to the relevant locations, or if it's rained at those locations.  We also need to ensure the hiker has energy.

Here's an improved initial state in PDDL that will make the problem solvable, while still adhering to the constraint of not *directly* stating the goal:

```pddl
(define (problem hike-preference)
  (:domain hiking)
  (:objects
    h1 - hiker
    A B C D - location)
  (:init
    (at h1 A)
    (path-clear A B)
    (path-clear B C)
    (path-clear C D)
    (path-clear A C) ; Added path to help solve the problem
    (not (rained A))
    (not (rained B))
    (not (rained C))
    (not (rained D))
    (has-energy h1)
  )
)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Clear Paths:** I've added `(path-clear B C)`, `(path-clear C D)`, and `(path-clear A C)`.  These establish that paths *do* exist between the locations needed to reach the goal.  Without these, the `walk` action's precondition would always fail.  A path from A to C is helpful to ensure a plan exists.
2. **No Rain:** I've added `(not (rained A))`, `(not (rained B))`, `(not (rained C))`, and `(not (rained D))`. The `walk` action requires `(not (rained ?to))`. Without this, the hiker could never move beyond the starting location.
3. **Initial Energy:** Added `(has-energy h1)`. This ensures the hiker is ready to move without needing to first `rest`.

**Why this is a valid solution:**

This initial state provides enough information for the planner to:

*   The hiker starts at A.
*   Paths exist to move between locations.
*   It doesn't rain at any location.
*   The hiker has enough energy.

The planner can then use the `walk` action repeatedly to move from A -> B -> C -> D, achieving the goal `(at h1 D)`. The `prefer` predicate is removed, as it is not defined in the domain.

This corrected initial state makes the problem solvable without directly including the goal state.  The planner has to *discover* the path to D through the available actions and initial conditions.
