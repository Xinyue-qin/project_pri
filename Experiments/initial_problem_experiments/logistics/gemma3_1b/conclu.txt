Based on the provided log files and plan output, here is an analysis of Gemma3:1B's capability to complete PDDL problem files with missing initial states in the logistics domain:

Overall Assessment
Gemma3:1B demonstrates limited success in completing missing initial states for logistics problems. The model shows some understanding of PDDL syntax but struggles significantly with semantic consistency and domain understanding.

Detailed Analysis by Problem File
1. p1_by_LLMs.pddl - ❌ UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM
Result: Translator detected "No relaxed solution! Generating unsolvable task."

Analysis:

The problem was reduced to only 1 variable and 2 facts, indicating fundamental contradictions

Gemma3:1B likely added initial states that conflict with the goal or domain constraints

The model failed to maintain logical consistency for this problem

2. p2_by_LLMs.pddl - ✅ SUCCESS
Result: Perfectly solved with a valid plan (cost=5).

Analysis:

Excellent performance: The translator parsed successfully and found an optimal solution

The plan sequence is logical: load both packages → fly → unload both packages

This indicates Gemma3:1B correctly identified and added appropriate missing initial states

The model likely added proper initial conditions like (at plane1 airport1), (at pkg1 airport1), (at pkg2 airport1), and necessary in-city predicates

3. p3_by_LLMs.pddl - ❌ UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM
Result: Same unsolvable pattern as p1.

Analysis:

Syntactically valid but semantically impossible

The consistent reduction to 1 variable and 2 facts suggests Gemma3:1B added contradictory predicates

The model struggles with maintaining logical consistency across different problem instances

4. p4_by_LLMs.pddl - ❌ UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM
Result: Identical unsolvable outcome.

Analysis:

Despite more complex initial processing (108 relevant atoms, 67 auxiliary atoms), the problem was still reduced to an unsolvable task

This suggests the model's additions created fundamental contradictions that couldn't be resolved

5. p5_by_LLMs.pddl - ❌ UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM
Result: Same unsolvable pattern with the most complex initial processing.

Analysis:

Showed the most extensive initial processing (170 relevant atoms, 90 auxiliary atoms)

Yet still resulted in an unsolvable problem reduced to 1 variable

Indicates that complexity doesn't correlate with correctness for this model

Key Findings
Strengths:

Can occasionally produce syntactically correct and semantically valid completions (p2 success)

Shows some understanding of logistics domain operations when successful

Maintains basic PDDL syntax structure across all attempts

Weaknesses:

Inconsistent Performance: Only 1 out of 5 problems was solvable (20% success rate)

Semantic Inconsistency: Frequently creates contradictory initial states that make problems unsolvable

Lack of Robustness: Fails on problems with similar characteristics where it succeeded previously

Domain Understanding: Limited comprehension of logistics constraints and reachability requirements

Pattern Recognition:

The consistent reduction to "1 variable, 2 facts" across failed problems suggests a systematic error in how the model completes missing states

This pattern indicates the model may be adding predicates that directly contradict the goal state or domain physics

Comparative Analysis with Previous Models
Compared to the Devstral model results:

Similar Success Rate: Both models achieved 20% success (1/5 problems solved)

Different Failure Patterns: Devstral showed more variety in failure types (syntax errors, object hallucination), while Gemma3:1B consistently produced syntactically correct but semantically unsolvable problems

Plan Quality: The successful plan from Gemma3:1B (p2) shows good understanding of parallel loading/unloading operations

Recommendations for Improvement
Constraint Validation: Implement checks to ensure added predicates don't conflict with existing states or goals

Domain-Specific Training: Enhance training with logistics domain constraints and common-sense spatial reasoning

Consistency Checking: Add post-generation validation to verify that completed problems have relaxed solutions

Error Analysis: Study the pattern of "1 variable, 2 facts" reduction to understand the specific types of contradictions the model introduces

The results suggest that while Gemma3:1B shows potential in PDDL completion tasks, it requires significant improvements in semantic understanding and consistency checking to be reliably useful for logistics domain problem generation. The model's performance is currently too inconsistent for practical applications.
