Okay, let's analyze why the initial state is unsolvable and then construct an alternative one. The primary issue is the lack of a clear path from the airport to city3. The initial state has `(loc airport2 city3)` but doesn't describe *how* pkg2 gets from the airport to city3.

Here’s a revised initial state that allows the problem to be solved:

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-4)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 pkg2 - object
    truck1 truck2 - truck
    plane1 - airplane
    loc1 loc2 loc3 - location
    airport1 airport2 - airport
    city1 city2 city3 - city
  )
  (:init
    ; City 1 locations
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc airport1 city1)
    
    ; City 2 locations
    (loc loc2 city2)
    
    ; City 3 locations (only needs airport since we're delivering to loc3)
    (loc loc3 city3)
    (loc airport2 city3)  ; Sharing airport2 between city2 and city3
    
    ; Vehicles
    (at truck1 loc1)
    (at truck2 airport2)
    (at plane1 airport1)
    
    ; Packages
    (at pkg1 loc1)
    (at pkg2 airport1)
    (at pkg1 loc3) ; Move pkg1 to loc3 initially
  )
  (:goal (and (at pkg1 loc3) (at pkg2 loc2)))
```

**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning:**

1.  **Added `(at pkg1 loc3)`:**  This is the crucial addition.  We're now stating that package 1 is initially at location `loc3`. This provides the starting point for the delivery of `pkg1`.  It's explicitly stated, giving the planner the information needed to first move pkg1 to loc3, and then move pkg2 to loc2.

**Why this is solvable:**

With this modified initial state, the planner can:

1.  Load `pkg1` onto `truck1` at `loc1`.
2.  Drive `truck1` to `loc3`.
3.  Load `pkg2` onto `truck2` at `airport2`.
4.  Fly `plane1` to `airport2`.
5.  Load `pkg2` onto `truck2`.
6.  Drive `truck2` to `loc2`.

This creates a straightforward sequence of actions leading to the goal state.
