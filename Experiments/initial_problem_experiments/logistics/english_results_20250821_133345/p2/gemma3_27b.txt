========================================

You're right, the problem is unsolvable as stated because there's no way to connect the locations. We need to establish the `loc` predicates to tell the planner how the cities and locations relate. Also, for the problem to be solvable, the `airport2` needs to be associated with `city2`. Here's a corrected initial state, along with the necessary `loc` predicates added to the initial state:

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-2)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 pkg2 - object
    truck1 - truck
    plane1 - airplane
    loc1 - location
    airport1 airport2 - airport
    city1 city2 - city
  )
  (:init
    (at truck1 airport1)
    (at plane1 airport1)
    (at pkg1 airport1)
    (at pkg2 airport1)

    ;; Add the location relationships
    (loc airport1 city1)
    (loc airport2 city2)
    (loc loc1 city1)

    ;;Important: Link the cities
    (loc city1 city2)
  )
  (:goal (and (at pkg1 airport2) (at pkg2 airport2))))
```

**Explanation of changes:**

* **`(loc airport1 city1)` and `(loc airport2 city2)`:** These predicates establish that `airport1` is located in `city1` and `airport2` in `city2`. This is essential for the `drive` and `fly` actions to work correctly.
* **`(loc loc1 city1)`**: Connects a general location to a city. It's not strictly *necessary*, but adds more possibilities.
* **`(loc city1 city2)`:** This is the most critical addition. It links the two cities together, enabling the planner to reason about travel *between* them. Without this, the planner has no way to establish a route.  We can use the truck to go from city1 to city2 and then use the airplane to transport the packages.

With these added predicates, the planner now has enough information to find a plan to move `pkg1` and `pkg2` to `airport2`.  A valid plan would involve using the truck to travel between cities and using the airplane to go between airports.
