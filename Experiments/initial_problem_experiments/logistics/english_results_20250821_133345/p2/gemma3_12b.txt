Okay, you're correct; the initial state lacks essential information. Specifically, it doesn't establish the crucial `loc` predicates (linking locations to cities) and doesn't link `loc1` to either `city1` or `city2`.  Without these, the `drive` action can't be used, and there's no apparent way to get the packages from `airport1` to `airport2`. Let's fix this.

Here's an alternative initial state that allows a solution, focusing on providing the necessary location-city relationships and allowing for a simple drive sequence.  I'm assuming a route involves the two cities and locations connected to them.

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-2-fixed)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 pkg2 - object
    truck1 - truck
    plane1 - airplane
    loc1 - location
    airport1 airport2 - airport
    city1 city2 - city
  )
  (:init
    (at truck1 airport1)
    (at plane1 airport1)
    (at pkg1 airport1)
    (at pkg2 airport1)

    ;; Establish location-city relationships.  Essential for driving.
    (loc airport1 city1)
    (loc airport2 city2)

    ;; Define a location 'loc1' as an intermediary location which is in city1
    (loc loc1 city1)
  )
  (:goal (and (at pkg1 airport2) (at pkg2 airport2)))
)
```

**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning:**

*   **`loc airport1 city1)` and `loc airport2 city2)`:**  These predicates are absolutely critical. The `drive` action *requires* the `loc` predicate to be true for the `from` and `to` locations. Without these, the planner cannot determine if a drive is possible between the airports. I've assigned `airport1` to `city1` and `airport2` to `city2` to allow a plausible route.
*   **`loc loc1 city1)`:** We introduce an intermediate location `loc1` to facilitate a `drive` action from `airport1` to `loc1`, then subsequently from `loc1` to `airport2`. This requires a location to be linked to a city.

**Why this works and possible plans:**

With this initial state, a possible plan might look like this (assuming the planner is smart enough to arrange the actions):

1.  `load (pkg1 truck1 airport1)`  (Load pkg1 onto the truck)
2.  `load (pkg2 truck1 airport1)`  (Load pkg2 onto the truck)
3.  `drive (truck1 airport1 loc1 city1)`
4.  `unload (pkg1 truck1 loc1)`
5.  `unload (pkg2 truck1 loc1)`
6.  `drive (truck1 loc1 airport2 city2)`

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Realism:** This alternative initial state is still a simplified representation. In a more complex logistics problem, you'd likely have constraints on what can be loaded onto a vehicle, distances between locations, road networks, flight schedules, etc.
*   **Planner Capabilities:** The ability of the planner to find a good plan depends on its sophistication. A simple STRIPS planner might still struggle if the problem space is too complex.
*   **Domain Specific Knowledge:** A more robust solution would likely involve incorporating more domain-specific knowledge, such as mapping locations to cities and defining more realistic costs and constraints.

This revised initial state gives the planner the necessary information to determine that it *can* move the packages from `airport1` to `airport2` using the available resources and actions.
