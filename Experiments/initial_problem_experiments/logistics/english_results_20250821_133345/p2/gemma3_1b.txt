PROBLEM: p2
MODEL: gemma3:1b

========================================

Here's an alternative initial state that achieves the goal of the problem while still leveraging the existing domain descriptions:

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-2)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 pkg2 - object
    truck1 - truck
    plane1 - airplane
    loc1 - location
    airport1 airport2 - airport
    city1 city2 - city
  )
  (:init
    (at truck1 airport1)
    (at plane1 airport1)
    (at pkg1 airport1)
    (at pkg2 airport1)
  )
  (:goal (and (at pkg1 airport2) (at pkg2 airport2))))
```

**Explanation of the Change:**

* **Removed `(at pkg1 airport2)`:** The initial state explicitly states that `pkg1` is at `airport1`.  Removing this ensures that the initial state doesn't contain the *specific* goal of the problem, allowing the planning system to focus on the overall goal of having `pkg1` at `airport2`.

This revised state maintains the relationships defined in the original domain descriptions and allows for a straightforward and achievable planning scenario. It's a better starting point than simply trying to directly incorporate the `at` predicates without a broader context.
