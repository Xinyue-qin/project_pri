Consider this domain description:

(define (domain logistics)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types
    physobj
    object vehicle - physobj
    truck airplane - vehicle
    location - physobj
    airport - location
    city
  )
  (:predicates
    (loc ?l - location ?c - city)
    (at ?x - physobj ?l - location)
    (in ?p - object ?v - vehicle)
  )

  (:action load
    :parameters (?o - object ?v - vehicle ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?v ?l) (at ?o ?l))
    :effect (and (in ?o ?v) (not (at ?o ?l)))
  )

  (:action unload
    :parameters (?o - object ?v - vehicle ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (in ?o ?v) (at ?v ?l))
    :effect (and (at ?o ?l) (not (in ?o ?v)))
  )

  (:action drive
    :parameters (?t - truck ?from - location ?to - location ?c - city)
    :precondition (and (at ?t ?from) (loc ?from ?c) (loc ?to ?c))
    :effect (and (at ?t ?to) (not (at ?t ?from)))
  )

  (:action fly
    :parameters (?p - airplane ?from - airport ?to - airport)
    :precondition (at ?p ?from)
    :effect (and (at ?p ?to) (not (at ?p ?from)))
  )
)


And this problem associated to it:

(define (problem logistics-3)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 pkg2 pkg3 - object
    truck1 truck2 - truck
    plane1 - airplane
    loc1 loc2 - location
    airport1 airport2 - airport
    city1 city2 - city
  )
  (:init
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc airport1 city1)
    (loc loc2 city2)
    (loc airport2 city2)
    (at pkg1 loc1)
    (at pkg2 airport1)
    (at pkg3 airport2)
  )
  (:goal (and (at pkg1 loc2) (at pkg2 airport2) (at pkg3 loc1)))
)



The planning task is unsolvable due to an incomplete initial state description. Can you provide an alternative initial state in PDDL from which the goals are achievable? This state must not include the goals directly.
