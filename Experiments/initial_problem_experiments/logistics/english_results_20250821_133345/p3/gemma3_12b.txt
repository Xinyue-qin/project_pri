You are correct. The original problem description is unsolvable because there are no trucks or airplanes initially *at* locations where they are needed to move the packages. The locations of vehicles are unknown, so no packages can be transported.  Here's an achievable alternative initial state that provides the necessary vehicles at the appropriate locations without directly stating the goal:

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-3-solvable)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 pkg2 pkg3 - object
    truck1 truck2 - truck
    plane1 - airplane
    loc1 loc2 - location
    airport1 airport2 - airport
    city1 city2 - city
  )
  (:init
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc airport1 city1)
    (loc loc2 city2)
    (loc airport2 city2)
    (at pkg1 loc1)
    (at pkg2 airport1)
    (at pkg3 airport2)
    (at truck1 loc1)
    (at plane1 airport1)
  )
  (:goal (and (at pkg1 loc2) (at pkg2 airport2) (at pkg3 loc1)))
)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **` (at truck1 loc1)`:** We're placing `truck1` at `loc1` to enable driving `pkg1` to `loc2`.
*   **`(at plane1 airport1)`:**  We're placing `plane1` at `airport1` to allow movement of `pkg2` to `airport2`.

This revised initial state provides the vehicles needed to achieve the specified goals.  The key is ensuring the vehicles are present at the *starting* locations relevant to the packages' desired destinations.  This avoids directly specifying the goal state in the initial state.
