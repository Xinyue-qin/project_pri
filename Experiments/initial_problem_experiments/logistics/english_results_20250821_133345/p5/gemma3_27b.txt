========================================

Okay, you're right, the original problem is likely unsolvable because there's no initial state for `pkg3`.  Also, without knowing where objects initially are, planning is impossible. Here's a revised `:init` section in PDDL that provides a complete initial state and makes the goals achievable. I've placed `pkg3` at `loc2` and `pkg4` at `airport3` to start.

```pddl
(:init
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc airport1 city1)
    (loc loc2 city2)
    (loc airport2 city2)
    (loc loc3 city3)
    (loc airport3 city3)
    (at truck1 loc1)
    (at plane1 airport1)
    (at plane2 airport2)
    (at pkg1 loc1)
    (at pkg2 airport1)
    (at pkg3 loc2)
    (at pkg4 airport3)
)
```

**Explanation of Changes and Why it Works:**

*   **Complete Initial State:** We've added `(at pkg3 loc2)` so that `pkg3` exists in the world from the start.
*   **Achievability:**  With this initial state, a planner *should* be able to find a sequence of actions to achieve the goal:
    *   Move `pkg1` from `loc1` to `loc3` (using truck1).
    *   Move `pkg2` from `airport1` to `airport3` (using plane1 or plane2).
    *   Move `pkg3` from `loc2` to `loc1` (using truck2 or truck3)
    *   Move `pkg4` from `airport3` to `airport2` (using plane1 or plane2).
*   **No Goal Inclusion:** The revised `:init` section does *not* include the goals directly. It only describes the starting arrangement of objects.

**Complete Problem Definition (for clarity):**

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-5)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 pkg2 pkg3 pkg4 - object
    truck1 truck2 truck3 - truck
    plane1 plane2 - airplane
    loc1 loc2 loc3 - location
    airport1 airport2 airport3 - airport
    city1 city2 city3 - city
  )
  (:init
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc airport1 city1)
    (loc loc2 city2)
    (loc airport2 city2)
    (loc loc3 city3)
    (loc airport3 city3)
    (at truck1 loc1)
    (at plane1 airport1)
    (at plane2 airport2)
    (at pkg1 loc1)
    (at pkg2 airport1)
    (at pkg3 loc2)
    (at pkg4 airport3)
  )
  (:goal (and (at pkg1 loc3) (at pkg2 airport3) 
               (at pkg3 loc1) (at pkg4 airport2)))
)
```

This revised problem should be solvable by a PDDL planner.  If it still fails, it would likely be due to subtle issues with the domain definition or a bug in the planner itself.
