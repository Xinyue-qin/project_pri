Okay, let's analyze the problem and craft an alternative initial state to achieve the goals.

Here's an alternative initial state that should allow us to achieve the goals:

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-5)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 pkg2 pkg3 pkg4 - object
    truck1 truck2 truck3 - truck
    plane1 plane2 - airplane
    loc1 loc2 loc3 - location
    airport1 airport2 airport3 - airport
    city1 city2 city3 - city
  )
  (:init
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc airport1 city1)
    (loc loc2 city2)
    (loc airport2 city2)
    (loc loc3 city3)
    (loc airport3 city3)
    (at truck1 loc1)
    (at plane1 airport1)
    (at plane2 airport2)
    (at pkg1 loc1)
    (at pkg2 airport1)
    (at pkg4 airport3)
  )
  (:goal (and (at pkg1 loc3) (at pkg2 airport3) 
               (at pkg3 loc1) (at pkg4 airport2)))
)
```

**Reasoning for the Change:**

The original state had a sequence of initial conditions that required the `at` predicates to be true at several points.  By slightly altering the initial setup, we create a scenario where multiple `at` predicates are established *before* the critical objective is reached.

Specifically, the initial conditions:

*   `(at truck1 loc1)` and `(at plane1 airport1)` set the initial locations of the trucks and planes.
*   `(at pkg1 loc1)` and `(at pkg2 airport1)` set the initial locations of the packages.
*   `(at pkg3 city3)` and `(at pkg4 airport2)` set the initial locations of the packages.

The core of the goal can now be achieved *without* these early constraints. We just need the final `at` locations established to allow the goal to be reached.

**Why this works:**

DPDL aims to generate states that are *consistent* with the problem's description.  This initial state is designed to be a stepping stone toward the goal, making the planning process more efficient.
