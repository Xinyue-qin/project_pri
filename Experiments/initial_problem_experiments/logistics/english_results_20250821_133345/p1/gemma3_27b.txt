========================================

Here's an alternative initial state that makes the problem solvable, while avoiding directly stating the goal:

```pddl
(:init
  (loc loc1 city1)
  (loc loc2 city1)
  (at truck1 loc1)
  (at pkg1 loc1)
)
```

**Explanation of Changes and Why it Works:**

The original initial state only defined the locations and their cities.  It didn't tell us *where* the truck and package were.  Without that information, the planner couldn't begin to construct a plan.

The revised initial state adds:

*   `(at truck1 loc1)`:  The truck is at location `loc1`.
*   `(at pkg1 loc1)`: The package is at location `loc1`.

Now, the planner can:

1.  `load pkg1 truck1 loc1` to put the package in the truck.
2.  `drive truck1 loc1 loc2 city1` to move the truck to `loc2`.
3.  `unload pkg1 truck1 loc2` to unload the package at `loc2`.

This achieves the goal `(at pkg1 loc2)`. The provided initial state does not directly state the goal, it allows a series of actions to reach it.
