Okay, you're right. The initial state is incomplete.  Specifically, we lack information about where the truck and package start. The `drive` action requires the truck to be somewhere initially and the package needs to be somewhere to be loaded. The `at` predicates are missing from the initial state.

Here's a revised initial state that allows for a solution, avoiding directly specifying the goal state:

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-problem)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 - object
    truck1 - truck
    loc1 loc2 - location
    city1 - city
  )
  (:init
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc loc2 city1)
    (at truck1 loc1)
    (at pkg1 loc1)
  )
  (:goal (at pkg1 loc2))
)
```

**Explanation of the Changes:**

*   **`(at truck1 loc1)`:**  We add that the `truck1` is initially at `loc1`. This satisfies the preconditions for the `drive` action, allowing the truck to move.
*   **`(at pkg1 loc1)`:** We add that the package `pkg1` is initially at `loc1`.  This allows it to be loaded onto the truck.

**Why this works:**

With this added information, a planner can now:

1.  Load `pkg1` onto `truck1` at `loc1`.
2.  Drive `truck1` from `loc1` to `loc2`.
3.  Unload `pkg1` at `loc2`.

This accomplishes the goal without explicitly stating the initial location of the goal object, adhering to your request to provide an alternative initial state that *doesn't* directly specify the goals.
