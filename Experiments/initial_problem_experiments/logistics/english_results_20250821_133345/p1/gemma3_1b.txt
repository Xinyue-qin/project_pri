========================================

Okay, let's analyze the problem and craft a viable initial state to achieve the goal.  The core issue is we need a state that establishes the initial location of `pkg1` and `loc2` without directly stating the goal.

Here's a proposed initial state:

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-problem)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 - object
    truck1 - truck
    loc1 loc2 - location
    city1 - city
  )
  (:init
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc loc2 city1)
  )
  (:goal (at pkg1 loc2))
)
```

**Reasoning:**

*   **`loc loc1 city1`**:  This establishes the initial location of `pkg1` as `loc1` in `city1`.  This is a prerequisite for the goal to be achieved.
*   **`loc loc2 city1`**: This establishes the initial location of `loc2` as `loc2` in `city1`. This reinforces the initial state.

**Why this is a good solution:**

It provides the necessary context for the planning task. It's a minimal, but clear, starting point.  It doesn't contain the goal itself, but sets the stage where the planning algorithm can deduce the final state.  This is more robust than attempting to introduce a goal directly, as it allows the planning tool to work toward a defined location.

**In summary, this initial state is sufficient to begin the planning process.**  We can then refine it with further specification as needed.
