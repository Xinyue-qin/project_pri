Okay, here's the PDDL Action definition based on your provided predicates, 
formatted for clarity.  I've focused on creating the core actions as 
requested.

**PDDL Action Definition:**

```pddl
action pick-up
  extend forall m     // Extend forall to handle the 'agent' identifier
   precondition action pick-up
  when
    agent has-package
    agent at-location
    package requested
  then
    agent pick-up package-l
  else
    agent pick-up package-d
```

**Explanation and Reasoning:**

*   **`action pick-up`**:  Defines the action named "pick-up".
*   **`extend forall m`**:  This is a critical addition. It tells the PDDL 
engine that this action will use a `m` (meta-action) that needs to be 
identified as the agent.
*   **` precondition action pick-up`**:  Specifies a condition that *must* 
be true before the action can run.
*   **`when`**:  Defines the conditions that must be met for the action to 
be executed.
    *   `agent has-package`: Ensures the agent has a package.
    *   `agent at-location`:  Ensures the agent is at the specified 
location.
    *   `package requested`: Ensures the agent is carrying a package.
*   **`then`**:  Specifies what should happen *if* the conditions are met.
    *   `agent pick-up package-l`:  The agent picks up the package at 
location `package-l`.
*   **`else`**: Specifies what should happen *if* the conditions are *not* 
met.
    *   `agent pick-up package-d`: The agent picks up the package at 
location `package-d` (a default location).

**Key Considerations & Potential Enhancements:**

*   **More Detailed Agent State:**  In a full implementation, you'd likely 
want to define the agent's state as a more complete representation (e.g., 
a `status` attribute, or a custom state type).
*   **Error Handling:**  The `when` clause could be enhanced with error 
handling to manage cases where the preconditions aren't met.

This provides a solid starting point for the PDDL Action definition.  Let 
me know if you'd like me to refine it further (e.g., add specific package 
locations, error handling, or a more elaborate state representation).
