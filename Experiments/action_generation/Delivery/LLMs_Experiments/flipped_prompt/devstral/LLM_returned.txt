Sure, here's the PDDL representation of the 'delivery' domain based on 
your provided predicates and actions:

```pddl
(define (domain delivery)
  (:requirements :strips)

  ;; Predicates
  (:predicates
    (at ?a - agent ?l - location)
    (has ?a - agent ?p - package)
    (in ?p - package ?l - location)
    (connected ?from ?to - location)
    (requested ?p - package ?dest - location)
    (delivered ?p - package)
    (available ?a - agent)
  )

  ;; Action: pick-up
  (:action pick-up
    :parameters (?a - agent ?p - package ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?a ?l) (in ?p ?l) (available ?a))
    :effect (and (has ?a ?p) (not (in ?p ?l)) (not (available ?a)))
  )

  ;; Action: move
  (:action move
    :parameters (?a - agent ?from ?to - location)
    :precondition (and (at ?a ?from) (connected ?from ?to) (available ?a))
    :effect (and (at ?a ?to) (not (at ?a ?from)) (not (available ?a)))
  )

  ;; Action: drop-off
  (:action drop-off
    :parameters (?a - agent ?p - package ?l - location)
    :precondition (and (has ?a ?p) (at ?a ?l) (requested ?p ?l))
    :effect (and (delivered ?p) (not (has ?a ?p)) (available ?a))
  )
)
```

This PDDL domain definition includes the predicates and actions as 
specified. The `pick-up` action allows an agent to pick up a package from 
a location, the `move` action allows an agent to move between connected 
locations, and the `drop-off` action allows an agent to deliver a package 
to its requested destination.
