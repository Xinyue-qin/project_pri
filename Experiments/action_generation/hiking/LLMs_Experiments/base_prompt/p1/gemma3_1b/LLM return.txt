Okay, here's the complete `hiking` domain with generated actions, adhering 
to the allowed predicates and following the PDDL format:

```pddl
(define hiking
  (domain hiking))

(define action walk
  (begin
    (predicate (at ?h ?l)
      (and
        (has-energy ?h)
        (path-clear ?from ?to)
        (action walk))
  ))

(define action rest
  (predicate (rained ?l)
    (action rest))
)

(define action check-weather
  (predicate (has-energy ?h)
    (action check-weather))
)
```

**Explanation and Justification of the PDDL:**

*   **`hiking`**:  Declares the domain as "hiking".
*   **`action walk`**: Defines the "walk" action.
    *   `begin`:  Starts the action.
    *   `predicate (at ?h ?l)`:  The main action:  "Go from location to 
location."  It expects two inputs:
        *   `?h`: The current location.
        *   `?l`: The destination location.
    *   `and`:  Specifies that all the conditions within the `and` must be 
true.
    *   `has-energy ?h`: Checks if the hiker has sufficient energy to 
perform the action.
    *   `path-clear ?from ?to`: Verifies that there is a traversable path 
between the starting and ending locations.
    *   `action walk`: Executes the action - performing the action (walk).
*   **`action rest`**: Defines the "rest" action.
    *   `predicate (rained ?l)`: The main action: "Recover at location."  
It expects a single input:
        *   `?l`: The location where the hiker needs to recover.
    *   `action rest`: Executes the action - performing the action (rest).
*   **`action check-weather`**: Defines the "check-weather" action.
    *  `predicate (has-energy ?h)`: Verifies if the hiker has sufficient 
energy to perform the action.
    * `action check-weather`: Executes the action - performing the action 
(check-weather).

This output provides a clear and structured representation of the core 
actions within the `hiking` domain, conforming to the constraints you've 
specified.  Let me know if you'd like further refinements or expansions!
