Certainly! To make the problem solvable, we need to ensure that all preconditions 
for actions leading towards the goal are met. In this case, the hiker (h1) needs 
to be at a starting location and the weather condition at each location should 
either be clear or checkable.

Given the current problem definition:
- The path from camp to summit is clear.
- H1 has energy.

However, there's no initial condition specifying where H1 starts. Let's assume H1 
starts at the base camp since it's a common starting point in hiking problems and 
add necessary conditions to make sure the plan can proceed smoothly.

Hereâ€™s an alternative initial state that makes the goal achievable:

```pddl
(define (problem hike-easy)
  (:domain hiking)
  (:objects
    h1 - hiker
    base camp summit - location)
  (:init
    ; H1 starts at the base camp
    (at h1 base)
    (path-clear base camp)
    (path-clear camp summit)
    (has-energy h1)
    ; No rain initially assumed for simplicity, but this could also be handled by 
including check-weather actions in the plan
  )
  (:goal (at h1 summit))
)
```

In this modified problem:
1. H1 starts at the base location (`(at h1 base)`).
2. A path is cleared from the base to camp and from camp to summit.
3. H1 has energy.

This should make the planning task solvable as it satisfies all necessary 
preconditions for actions in the domain.
