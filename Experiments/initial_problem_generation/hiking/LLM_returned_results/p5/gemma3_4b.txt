Okay, you're right. The original initial state is designed to be unsolvable. Here's an alternative initial state in PDDL that allows the goal (h1 at summit) to be achieved, without explicitly stating the goal:

```pddl
(define (problem hike-solvable)
  (:domain hiking)
  (:objects
    h1 - hiker
    base rest-area danger-zone summit - location)
  (:init
    (at h1 base)
    (path-clear base rest-area)
    (path-clear rest-area danger-zone)
    (path-clear danger-zone summit) ; Added this line
    (rained summit) ; Added this line
    (not (has-energy h1))
  )
```

**Explanation of Changes and Why They Work:**

1.  **`(path-clear danger-zone summit)`**: This is the key addition.  Without a clear path from the `danger-zone` to the `summit`, the `walk` action cannot be applied, making the goal impossible.

2. **`(rained summit)`**: This ensures that the initial weather condition at the summit is unfavorable, encouraging the agent to check the weather.

With this revised initial state, the planning algorithm can now proceed as follows:

1.  `check-weather(summit)` will be executed.
2.  `rest(h1, summit)` will be executed.
3.  `walk(h1, summit, summit)` will be executed.
4.  The goal (at h1 summit) will be satisfied.

This approach focuses on establishing the necessary preconditions for successful traversal, rather than including the goal directly in the initial state, which is what makes the original problem unsolvable.
