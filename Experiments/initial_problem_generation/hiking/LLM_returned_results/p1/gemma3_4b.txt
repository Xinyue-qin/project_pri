========================================

Here's an alternative initial state description in PDDL that allows the problem to be solved, without directly including the goal:

```pddl
(define (problem hike-easy-alt)
  (:domain hiking)
  (:objects
    h1 - hiker
    base camp summit - location)
  (:init
    (path-clear camp summit)
    (at h1 camp)
    (has-energy h1)
    (not (rained summit))
  )
  (:goal (at h1 summit))
```

**Explanation of Changes and Why it Works:**

*   **Added `(at h1 camp)`:**  We explicitly state that the hiker `h1` starts at the `camp` location.
*   **Added `(not (rained summit))`:** This ensures that the weather is clear at the `summit` location. This eliminates a condition that was preventing the initial problem from being solved.

With this revised initial state, the planning algorithm can now:

1.  Start with `h1` at `camp`.
2.  Use `walk` to move `h1` to `summit`.
3.  Achieve the goal of `(at h1 summit)`.

This provides a complete and solvable scenario for the hiker.
