PROBLEM: p1

========================================

The original problem is unsolvable because the hiker starts *at* a location but there's no initial assertion that they are *at* a specific location. The plan can't start because the planner doesn't know where the hiker is.

Here's an alternative initial state that makes the problem solvable:

```pddl
(:init
  (path-clear camp summit)
  (has-energy h1)
  (at h1 camp)
)
```

**Explanation:**

I added `(at h1 camp)` to the initial state. This tells the planner that the hiker `h1` starts at the `camp` location.  Now, the planner can use the `walk` action to move from the `camp` to the `summit` and achieve the goal.  The `has-energy` and `path-clear` conditions, already present, are sufficient to allow the action to succeed. Critically, this initial state doesn't include the goal `(at h1 summit)` directly. The planner must *achieve* that goal through the available actions.
