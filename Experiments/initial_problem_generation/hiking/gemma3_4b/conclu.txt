Based on the provided log files and plan outputs from Fast Downward (FD) runs, we can analyze the performance of the Gemma3:4B model in completing PDDL problem files with missing initial states for the hiking domain. The analysis covers five problem instances (p1 to p5).

Overall Summary
Success Rate: 1/5 (20%) – Only p2 was successfully solved, while p1, p3, p4, and p5 failed due to syntax errors.

Successful Plan:

p2: Cost 2 – Hike from lodge to peak via trail

Failed Cases: p1, p3, p4, and p5 all failed with the same syntax error: Missing ')'.

No Semantic Errors: The only parsed problem (p2) was semantically correct and solvable.

Detailed Problem Analysis
1. p1_by_LLMs.pddl ❌ FAILURE (Syntax Error)
Error: Syntax error during parsing – Missing ')'.

Analysis: The model generated a PDDL file with unbalanced parentheses, indicating a basic syntax issue.

2. p2_by_LLMs.pddl ✅ SUCCESS
Translation: Successful. The translator instantiated 1 variable, 3 facts, and 2 operators.

Search: Solution found with cost 2.

Plan:
(walk h1 lodge trail)
(walk h1 trail peak)

Analysis: The model provided a complete and correct initial state. The planner generated a valid plan to hike from lodge to peak via trail.

3. p3_by_LLMs.pddl ❌ FAILURE (Syntax Error)
Error: Syntax error – Missing ')'.

Analysis: Same issue as p1. The model failed to produce syntactically correct PDDL.

4. p4_by_LLMs.pddl ❌ FAILURE (Syntax Error)
Error: Syntax error – Missing ')'.

Analysis: Again, a syntax error due to unbalanced parentheses.

5. p5_by_LLMs.pddl ❌ FAILURE (Syntax Error)
Error: Syntax error – Missing ')'.

Analysis: Same syntax issue as p1, p3, and p4.

Root Causes of Failure
Syntax Errors (80% of cases): The model consistently generated malformed PDDL with missing closing parentheses. This indicates a lack of attention to basic PDDL syntax.

Inconsistency: The model succeeded in one case (p2) but failed in others due to the same repetitive error.

Strengths and Weaknesses of Gemma3:4B
Strengths
Semantic Correctness for p2: For p2, the model produced a semantically correct initial state that led to a valid plan.

No Domain Errors: When the syntax was correct, the model understood the hiking domain requirements for p2.

Weaknesses
Syntax Errors: The model frequently generated PDDL with unbalanced parentheses, failing in 4 out of 5 cases.

Fragility: A single syntax error (missing parenthesis) can cause complete failure, highlighting the model's lack of robustness.

Inconsistency: The model's performance is unpredictable, working only for one problem but failing for others with the same error.

Comparison with Expected Behavior
A correctly completed problem file for the hiking domain should include:

All required objects (hikers, locations).

Initial predicates: (at h1 ?start_loc), (path ?from ?to) for connected locations.

Goal: (at h1 ?goal_loc).

Syntactically correct PDDL (e.g., balanced parentheses).

The Gemma3:4B model met these requirements only in 1 out of 5 cases.

Recommendations for Improvement
Syntax Validation: The model should be fine-tuned or prompted to generate syntactically correct PDDL (e.g., balanced parentheses). This is a basic requirement.

Output Parsing: Add a post-processing step to validate the generated PDDL syntax before passing it to the planner.

Domain-Specific Prompting: Provide examples of correct PDDL syntax for the hiking domain to reduce errors.

Error Feedback: Use the translator’s error messages (e.g., "Missing ')'") to refine the initial state.

Conclusion
The Gemma3:4B model demonstrates a limited ability to complete missing initial states for PDDL problems in the hiking domain. While it produced a correct and solvable problem for p2, it failed in 80% of cases due to repetitive syntax errors (missing parentheses). This suggests that the model lacks reliability and requires significant improvements in syntax handling.

Success Rate: 1/5 (20%)
Key Issue: Syntax errors (missing parentheses) in the majority of cases.
Recommendation: Implement syntax checks or use a post-processing step to ensure well-formed PDDL.

Note: The model's performance is inconsistent and not suitable for practical use without additional validation mechanisms. Larger models or fine-tuning on PDDL data may be necessary to improve reliability.
