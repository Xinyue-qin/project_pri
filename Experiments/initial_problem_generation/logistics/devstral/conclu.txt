Based on the provided log files and plan output, here is an analysis of Devstral's capability to complete PDDL problem files with missing initial states in the logistics domain:

Overall Assessment
Devstral demonstrates mixed performance in completing missing initial states for logistics problems. The success varies significantly depending on which specific initial conditions are missing and how the model chooses to complete them.

Detailed Analysis by Problem File
1. p1_by_LLMs.pddl - ✅ SUCCESS
Result: Perfectly solved with a valid plan (cost=3).

Analysis:

The translator parsed successfully without errors

The search found an optimal solution: load → drive → unload

This indicates Devstral correctly identified and added the missing initial state(s) in a way that maintains problem solvability

The model likely added appropriate initial conditions like (at truck1 loc1), (at pkg1 loc1), and (in-city loc1 city1) based on the context

2. p2_by_LLMs.pddl - ❌ SYNTAX ERROR
Result: Parser failed due to remaining tokens after goal definition.

Analysis:

The error "Tokens remaining after parsing" suggests Devstral added malformed content

The model likely appended additional text or improperly closed parentheses after the goal specification

This represents a basic syntax failure rather than semantic incompleteness

3. p3_by_LLMs.pddl - ❌ UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM
Result: Translator detected "No relaxed solution! Generating unsolvable task."

Analysis:

While syntactically correct, the completed problem is semantically unsolvable

The translator reduced the problem to only 1 variable and 2 facts, indicating fundamental contradictions

Devstral likely added initial states that conflict with the goal or domain constraints (e.g., placing packages in locations that cannot reach the goal)

4. p4_by_LLMs.pddl - ❌ UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM
Result: Same unsolvable pattern as p3.

Analysis:

Identical outcome to p3: syntactically valid but semantically impossible

The consistent failure across multiple problems suggests Devstral struggles with maintaining logical consistency when completing initial states

The model may be adding random or contradictory predicates without understanding the logistics domain constraints

5. p5_by_LLMs.pddl - ❌ SEMANTIC ERROR
Result: Undefined object plane3 in initial state.

Analysis:

Devstral introduced an object (plane3) not declared in the objects section

This shows the model sometimes hallucinates objects without ensuring they are properly defined

The error indicates poor understanding of PDDL's structure requirements

Key Findings
Strengths:

Can sometimes correctly infer missing initial states (p1 success)

Generally maintains basic PDDL syntax structure (except p2)

Weaknesses:

Syntax Errors: Occasionally produces malformed PDDL (p2)

Object Hallucination: Introduces undefined objects (p5)

Semantic Inconsistency: Creates unsolvable problems by adding contradictory initial states (p3, p4)

Domain Understanding: Limited comprehension of logistics domain constraints and reachability

Success Rate: 1/5 (20%) - Only p1 produced a solvable, correct problem

Recommendations for Improvement
Syntax Validation: Implement post-generation syntax checking

Domain Constraint Awareness: Incorporate domain-specific validation to avoid contradictory states

Object Consistency: Ensure all objects used in predicates are properly declared

Relaxed Solution Check: Verify that the completed problem has at least a relaxed solution before final output

The results suggest that while Devstral shows promise in PDDL completion, it requires significant improvements in semantic understanding and consistency checking to be reliably useful for logistics domain problem generation.
