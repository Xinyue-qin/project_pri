========================================

Okay, you're right to identify the problem. The original problem is unsolvable because there's no way to get `pkg1` from `loc1` to `loc3` utilizing the available vehicles and locations.  Specifically, the packages need to be *in* a vehicle before the vehicle moves.  Also, while `airport2` is defined in city3, it's not defined in city2.

Here's an alternative `(:init)` state that makes the problem solvable. I'll also explain the changes I made and why they're necessary.  I'll keep as much of the original structure as possible, just adding missing links to make a valid plan achievable.

```pddl
(:init
    ; City 1 locations
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc airport1 city1)
    
    ; City 2 locations
    (loc loc2 city2)
    (loc airport3 city2) ; New Airport for city 2

    ; City 3 locations (only needs airport since we're delivering to loc3)
    (loc loc3 city3)
    (loc airport2 city3)  ; Sharing airport2 between city3
    
    ; Vehicles
    (at truck1 loc1)
    (at truck2 airport2)
    (at plane1 airport1)
    
    ; Packages
    (at pkg1 loc1)
    (at pkg2 airport1)

    ;Crucial additions to make this solvable:
    ; Load pkg1 onto truck1
    (in pkg1 truck1)
    ; Load pkg2 onto plane1
    (in pkg2 plane1)

)
```

**Explanation of Changes and Why They're Needed:**

1. **Added Airport to City 2:**  We need an airport in city2 for `pkg2` to fly to the location.
2. **Loading Packages onto Vehicles:** The most critical change.  The original problem didn't specify that the packages were *in* any vehicle.  The `load` action requires this.  I've added `(in pkg1 truck1)` and `(in pkg2 plane1)` to the initial state. This puts them in a vehicle from the start, enabling the plan to begin.

**How a Plan Would Now Work (Outline):**

1. **Fly `plane1` from `airport1` to `airport2`:** This moves `pkg2` to the city 2 location.
2. **Unload `pkg2` from `plane1` at `airport2`:** Gets `pkg2` to the airport of city2.
3. **Drive `truck1` from `loc1` to `loc3`:** This moves `pkg1` to the city 3 location.
4. **Unload `pkg1` from `truck1` at `loc3`:** Delivers `pkg1` to its goal location.

Now, with these changes to the initial state, a planner should be able to find a plan to achieve the goal of having `pkg1` at `loc3` and `pkg2` at `loc2`.
