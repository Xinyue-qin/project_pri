========================================

To make the logistics problem solvable, we need to add appropriate information about the objects' locations and vehicle positions in the initial state. Here's an alternative initial state that should allow achieving the goal:

```pddl
(:init
  (loc loc1 city1)
  (loc loc2 city1)

  ; Initial positions of objects and vehicles
  (at pkg1 loc1)
  (at truck1 loc1)

  ; Ensure airports are defined for completeness if needed in future scenarios
  ;; If we assume loc1 and loc2 could be airports, or just locations in a city:
  ;; (loc loc1 airport) - This line is not necessary unless explicitly required by problem context

)
```

This initial state describes that `pkg1` and `truck1` are initially at location `loc1`, both of which are located in city `city1`. Now, you can load the package onto the truck and then drive to loc2.

Here's a more detailed version with comments explaining each line:

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-problem)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 - object
    truck1 - truck
    loc1 loc2 - location
    city1 - city
  )
  (:init
    ; Locations are within the same city
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc loc2 city1)

    ; Initial positions of the package and truck
    (at pkg1 loc1)   ; Package is at loc1 initially
    (at truck1 loc1)  ; Truck is also at loc1 initially

    ;; Additional initial conditions if needed for completeness:
    ;; We don't need to explicitly state locations as airports unless required.
    ;; For example, if we want to define these as airport type locations:
    ;; (loc loc1 airport)
    ;; (loc loc2 airport)

  )
  (:goal
    ; The goal is for the package to be at loc2
    (at pkg1 loc2)
  )
)
```

With this initial state, you can now create a plan that loads `pkg1` onto `truck1`, drives `truck1` from `loc1` to `loc2`, and then unloads `pkg1` at `loc2`. This will satisfy the goal `(at pkg1 loc2)`.
