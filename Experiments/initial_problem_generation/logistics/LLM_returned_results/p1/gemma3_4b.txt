Okay, here's an alternative initial state in PDDL for the `logistics-problem` that allows the goal `(at pkg1 loc2)` to be achieved.  I've focused on adding enough information to enable a series of `load`, `drive`, and `unload` actions.

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-problem-revised)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 - object
    truck1 - truck
    loc1 loc2 - location
    city1 - city
  )
  (:init
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc loc2 city1)
    (at pkg1 loc1)
  )
  (:goal (at pkg1 loc2))
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

I added the line: `(at pkg1 loc1)`

This states that the object `pkg1` is initially located at `loc1`.  This creates a clear starting point for the planning algorithm:

1.  **Load:** The algorithm can now `load` `pkg1` onto `truck1` at `loc1`.
2.  **Drive:**  `truck1` can then be driven to `loc2`.
3. **Unload:** Finally, `pkg1` can be unloaded at `loc2` which satisfies the goal.

This revised initial state provides sufficient information for the planning algorithm to find a solution.  The original state lacked a starting point for the object to be moved.  I've provided only the changes necessary to make the problem solvable.
