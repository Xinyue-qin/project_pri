========================================

To determine if we can find an alternative initial state that makes the problem solvable, let's analyze what the current problem setup requires:

1. We need to get `pkg1` to `loc3`
2. We need to get `pkg2` to `airport3`
3. We need to get `pkg3` to `loc1`
4. We need to get `pkg4` to `airport2`

Let's look at the current initial state and see what additional information is needed:

- `(at truck1 loc1)`: Truck1 is at loc1
- `(at plane1 airport1)`: Plane1 is at airport1
- `(at plane2 airport2)`: Plane2 is at airport2
- `(at pkg1 loc1)`: Package 1 is at loc1 (needs to go to loc3)
- `(at pkg2 airport1)`: Package 2 is at airport1 (needs to go to airport3)
- `(at pkg4 airport3)`: Package 4 is at airport3 (needs to go to airport2)

We don't have information about:
- `pkg3` - it needs to be at `loc1`
- `truck2`, `truck3` - their initial locations are not specified
- `plane3` - its initial location is also missing

Let's create a more complete initial state:

```pddl
(:init
  (loc loc1 city1)
  (loc airport1 city1)
  (loc loc2 city2)
  (loc airport2 city2)
  (loc loc3 city3)
  (loc airport3 city3)

  ; Vehicles positions
  (at truck1 loc1)
  (at truck2 loc2)
  (at truck3 loc3)
  (at plane1 airport1)
  (at plane2 airport2)
  (at plane3 airport3) ; Adding plane3

  ; Packages positions
  (at pkg1 loc1)
  (at pkg2 airport1)
  (at pkg3 loc1) ; Package 3 already at loc1 to satisfy the goal condition
  (at pkg4 airport3)
)
```

This initial state should be more complete and make it possible for all packages to reach their respective goals. Each truck or plane is now initialized to a location, and `pkg3` is already positioned where needed (`loc1`).

To summarize:

- Package 1 needs to go from loc1 to loc3 using truck1
- Package 2 needs to go from airport1 to airport3 using plane1
- Package 3 is already at loc1 (goal satisfied)
- Package 4 needs to go from airport3 to airport2 using plane3

Now the planning system can use these vehicles and positions to create a valid plan for achieving all the goals.
