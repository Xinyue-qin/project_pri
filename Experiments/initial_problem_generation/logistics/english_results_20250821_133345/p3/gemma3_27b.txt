Okay, you're right, the original problem is likely unsolvable because there's no way to get the trucks and plane to the required locations without specifying their initial locations. Here's an alternative initial state that makes the problem solvable, providing starting locations for the vehicles.  I'll also add `at` statements for the vehicles.

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-3-solvable)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 pkg2 pkg3 - object
    truck1 truck2 - truck
    plane1 - airplane
    loc1 loc2 - location
    airport1 airport2 - airport
    city1 city2 - city
  )
  (:init
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc airport1 city1)
    (loc loc2 city2)
    (loc airport2 city2)
    (at pkg1 loc1)
    (at pkg2 airport1)
    (at pkg3 airport2)
    (at truck1 loc1)
    (at truck2 airport1)
    (at plane1 airport1)
  )
  (:goal (and (at pkg1 loc2) (at pkg2 airport2) (at pkg3 loc1)))
)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **Vehicle Initial Locations:**  I added these lines:
    *   `(at truck1 loc1)`
    *   `(at truck2 airport1)`
    *   `(at plane1 airport1)`

    These place the vehicles at starting locations, allowing the planner to begin moving objects.  Without this, the planner has no way to start the sequence of actions needed to achieve the goal.

**Why this makes it solvable (outline of a possible plan):**

1.  **Load pkg1 onto truck1 at loc1.**
2.  **Drive truck1 from loc1 to loc2.**
3.  **Unload pkg1 at loc2.**
4.  **Load pkg2 onto plane1 at airport1.**
5.  **Fly plane1 from airport1 to airport2.**
6.  **Unload pkg2 at airport2.**
7.  **Load pkg3 onto truck2 at airport2.**
8.  **Drive truck2 from airport2 to loc1.**
9.  **Unload pkg3 at loc1.**

Now the planner should be able to find a plan that satisfies the goal.  The key was adding sufficient information to the initial state to allow the vehicles to *begin* moving.
