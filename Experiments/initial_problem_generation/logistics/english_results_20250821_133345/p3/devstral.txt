========================================

To make the problem solvable, we need to ensure that all vehicles have a defined starting location and that the objects can be moved by these vehicles according to the domain rules.

Here's an alternative initial state where:
1. Trucks start at specific locations within their respective cities.
2. The airplane starts at one of the airports.
3. All packages are already placed in appropriate locations as per the previous setup.

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-3)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 pkg2 pkg3 - object
    truck1 truck2 - truck
    plane1 - airplane
    loc1 loc2 - location
    airport1 airport2 - airport
    city1 city2 - city
  )
  (:init
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc airport1 city1)
    (loc loc2 city2)
    (loc airport2 city2)

    ; Vehicles' initial locations
    (at truck1 loc1)
    (at truck2 airport1)
    (at plane1 airport1)

    ; Packages' initial locations
    (at pkg1 loc1)
    (at pkg2 airport1)
    (at pkg3 airport2)
  )
  (:goal (and (at pkg1 loc2) (at pkg2 airport2) (at pkg3 loc1)))
)
```

This setup allows for the trucks and airplane to move packages between locations according to the domain rules.
