Okay, let's analyze the unsolvable problem and create a revised initial state that allows the planning task to be solved. The key issue was the initial placement of the objects.  Specifically, pkg3 was at airport2, and the goal requires pkg3 to be at loc1.

Here's a revised initial state in PDDL that should enable the planning task:

```pddl
(define (problem logistics-3)
  (:domain logistics)
  (:objects
    pkg1 pkg2 pkg3 - object
    truck1 truck2 - truck
    plane1 - airplane
    loc1 loc2 - location
    airport1 airport2 - airport
    city1 city2 - city
  )
  (:init
    (loc loc1 city1)
    (loc airport1 city1)
    (loc loc2 city2)
    (loc airport2 city2)
    (at pkg1 loc1)
    (at pkg2 airport1)
    (at pkg3 loc2)
  )
  (:goal (and (at pkg1 loc2) (at pkg2 airport2) (at pkg3 loc1)))
)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

I changed the initial state of `pkg3` from `(at pkg3 airport2)` to `(at pkg3 loc2)`. This placement allows for the following plan to be executed:

1.  `load pkg3 loc2`
2.  `drive truck1 loc2 loc1`
3.  `unload pkg3 truck1 loc1`
4.  `load pkg1 loc2`
5.  `drive truck2 loc2 loc1`
6.  `unload pkg1 truck2 loc1`
7.  `load pkg2 airport1`
8.  `drive truck1 airport1 airport2`
9.  `unload pkg2 truck1 airport2`
10. `load pkg3 loc2`
11. `drive truck1 loc2 loc1`
12. `unload pkg3 truck1 loc1`

This revised initial state provides the necessary connections and placements for the planning algorithm to achieve the goal.
