========================================

To make the problem solvable, we need to complete the initial state with all necessary information about locations and their relationships to cities. Here's a revised version of the initial state:

```pddl
(:init
  (at truck1 airport1)
  (at plane1 airport1)
  (at pkg1 airport1)
  (at pkg2 airport1)
  (loc airport1 city1)
  (loc airport2 city2)
))
```

This adds information about which cities the airports are located in, making it possible to plan actions that involve driving and flying between locations.
