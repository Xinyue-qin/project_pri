========================================

To make the logistics problem solvable, we need to ensure that the vehicles and objects are positioned in such a way that they can eventually reach their respective goals. Here's an alternative initial state where the planning task becomes feasible:

```pddl
(:init
  ; City 1 locations
  (loc loc1 city1)
  (loc airport1 city1)

  ; City 2 locations
  (loc loc2 city2)

  ; City 3 locations (only needs airport since we're delivering to loc3)
  (loc loc3 city3)
  (loc airport2 city3)  ; Sharing airport2 between city2 and city3

  ; Vehicles
  (at truck1 loc1)
  (at plane1 airport1)

  ; Packages
  (at pkg1 loc1)
  (at pkg2 airport1)

  ; Add the initial locations for all vehicles and objects to ensure they can move according to the problem constraints
  (in pkg1 truck1)  ; Package 1 is already loaded on truck 1 at location loc1
  (in pkg2 plane1)  ; Package 2 is already loaded on plane 1 at airport1

  ; Make sure that vehicle positions are correct and share the same city when needed
)
```

Here's how this setup helps:
- `pkg1` is already loaded on `truck1`, which is located in `loc1`. Since `loc1` and `airport1` are both in `city1`, we can drive `truck1` to `airport1`.
- Once at `airport1`, we can unload `pkg1` from `truck1` and load it onto `plane1` which will then fly to `airport2` in city3.
- `pkg2` is already loaded on `plane1` at `airport1`. We can directly fly `plane1` with both packages to `airport2`.
- At `airport2`, we unload the packages and truck them from `airport2` to their respective destinations.

This ensures that both packages can reach their goals: `pkg1` to `loc3` in city3, and `pkg2` to `loc2` in city2.
