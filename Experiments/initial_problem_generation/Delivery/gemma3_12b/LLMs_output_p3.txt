You're absolutely right. The initial state is incomplete as it doesn't 
specify robotB's availability. A robot must be available to perform 
actions. Hereâ€™s a corrected initial state:

```pddl
(:init
  (at robotA locX)(at robotB locZ)
  (in pkgX locX)
  (connected locX locY)(connected locY locZ)
  (requested pkgX locZ)
  (available robotA) ; RobotA is available
  (available robotB) ; RobotB is available
)
```

**Explanation of Change:**

*   **(available robotA)**: Indicates that robotA is available for action.
*   **(available robotB)**:  Indicates that robotB is available for 
action.

**Reasoning for Solvability:**

The `pick-up`, `move`, and `drop-off` actions all require that the agent 
is `available`. Without stating this in the initial state, the planning 
system cannot proceed.  This minimal addition allows a plan to be 
generated.  A possible plan could be:

1.  `pick-up(robotA pkgX locX)`
2.  `move(robotA locX locY)`
3.  `move(robotA locY locZ)`
4.  `drop-off(robotA pkgX locZ)`

This demonstrates the crucial role of the `available` predicate in the 
domain and how its inclusion is essential for solving the planning task.
