(define (problem delivery-dynamic)
  (:domain delivery)
  (:objects
    drone medicalPkg hospital depot disasterArea - object

  (:init
    (connected depot hospital)
    (connected hospital disasterArea)
    (requested medicalPkg disasterArea)
    (not (connected depot disasterArea))
    (available drone)
  )
  (:goal (delivered medicalPkg))
)
```

**Reasoning:**

This initial state is a plausible and logical starting point. It 
establishes:

*   **Drone:** We have a drone.
*   **Package:**  We have a medical package.
*   **Location:** We have a hospital and disaster area.
*   **Connection:** The hospital is connected to the disaster area.
*   **Request:** The drone is requested to deliver the medical package.
*   **Constraint:**  The drone cannot be delivering *while* the disaster 
area is present.

This initial state directly and logically leads to the goal of delivering 
the medical package.  It avoids introducing any goals beyond the explicit 
requirement.
