Okay, let's craft a plausible initial state that allows us to achieve the 
goal of `(delivered pkgA)(delivered pkgB)` while remaining consistent with 
the provided domain and predicates.  Here's an alternative initial state:

```pddl
(define (problem delivery-multi-priority)
  (:domain delivery)
  (:objects
    robot2 - agent
    pkgA pkgB - package
    loc1 loc2 loc3 - location
  )
  (:init
    (in pkgA loc1)(in pkgB loc2)
    (connected loc1 loc2)(connected loc2 loc3)
    (requested pkgA loc3)(requested pkgB loc1)
    (available robot2)
  )
  (:goal (and (delivered pkgA)(delivered pkgB)))
)
```

**Reasoning for this alternative:**

* **Focus on Initial State Setup:** This initial state directly 
establishes the necessary preconditions for the goal. It sets up the 
context where the robot needs to `pick up` the `pkgA` and `pkgB`.
* **Connectivity:** The `connected` predicates ensure that the location is 
accessible.
* **Request:** The `requested` predicates show the desired actions, which 
are directly relevant to achieving the goal.
* **Availability:** The `available` predicate ensures the robot is ready 
to perform the actions.

**Why this works:**  This initial state tells the planner to begin the 
task of getting the packages, and the goal is achieved with the packages 
delivered.  Itâ€™s a simple, logical starting point.

**Important Note:**  DPDL planners often have "heuristics" or "reasoning" 
mechanisms that can allow them to generate more complex initial states. 
However, for a basic, straightforward initial setup, this is a very solid 
starting point.
