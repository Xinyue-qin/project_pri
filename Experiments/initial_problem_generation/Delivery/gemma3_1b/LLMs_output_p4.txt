```pddl
(define (problem delivery-competition)
  (:domain delivery)
  (:objects
    courier1 courier2 - agent
    urgentPkg normalPkg - package
    warehouse station client - location
  )
  (:init
    (at courier1 warehouse)(at courier2 station)
    (connected station client)
    (requested urgentPkg client)(requested normalPkg client)
    (available courier1)(available courier2)
  )
  (:goal (and (delivered urgentPkg)(delivered normalPkg)))
)
```

**Reasoning for this alternative:**

This initial state is a clear and sensible starting point, aligning with 
the problem description. It establishes:

*   **Agents:**  We have two couriers (courier1 and courier2).
*   **Packages:**  We have one urgent package and one normal package.
*   **Locations:**  We have a station and a client.
*   **Connections:** The station and client are connected.
*   **Request:** The agents have requested the packages.

This initial state allows for a straightforward planning scenario – the 
couriers must go to the station and client to pick up the packages.  It’s 
a logical and achievable starting point.
