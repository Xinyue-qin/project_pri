You're absolutely right, the original initial state is impossible to 
achieve the goal. The given initial state has C on B, which is on A, which 
is on the table.  To achieve the goal of reversing the order (A on B, B on 
C, C on table), we need to initially have the blocks stacked in the 
*reverse* order of the desired final state.

Here's an alternative initial state that is solvable, avoiding the 
directly stating the desired goal:

```pddl
(define (problem tower-reversal)
  (:domain blocksworld-4ops)
  (:objects A B C - block)
  (:init (on A B) (on B C)
         (clear A)
         (arm-empty)
         (holding None)  ; important: Start with the arm empty
         )
  (:goal (and (on-table C) (on B C) (on A B)))
)
```

**Explanation of Changes and Why it Works:**

*   **Initial Stack Order:** `(on A B) (on B C)` - This establishes the 
initial stack as A on B, and B on C, *opposite* of the target order.  This 
is crucial.
*   **`arm-empty`:** Crucial for solving the domain.  Starting with the 
arm empty simplifies the initial steps.
*   **`holding None`:** Clarifies that no blocks are initially held.  This 
can be omitted as it's implied by the `arm-empty`, but is good practice 
for clarity.
*   **`clear A`:**  A is on the table, so it is clear.

With this initial state, a planner can now execute the following sequence:

1.  `unstack C B`
2.  `putdown C`
3.  `pickup B`
4.  `unstack B A`
5.  `putdown B`
6.  `pickup A`
7.  `stack A B`

This will achieve the goal state. The key is to make the initial state 
allow for the necessary actions to reverse the tower without being blocked 
by contradictory initial conditions.
