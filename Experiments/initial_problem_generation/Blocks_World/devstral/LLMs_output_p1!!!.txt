Certainly! The problem statement mentions that the goal is to achieve a specific 
configuration of blocks (A on B, B on C, and C remaining on-table). However, the 
current initial state might be incomplete or incorrect.

To make this planning task solvable, we need to provide an alternative initial state 
where the goals can be achieved. Since the problem description already specifies that 
all three blocks are clear and on-table in the initial state, we'll need to consider a 
different configuration of these blocks that still allows us to reach the goal without 
directly including the goal conditions.

One possible alternative initial state could be:

```pddl
(:init (on A B) (clear A) (on B C) (clear B))
```

This would mean initially block A is on block B, and block B is on block C. In this 
configuration:
- Block A is clear (no other block is stacked on top of it).
- Block B is not clear since block A is on top of it.
- Block C is on-table.

With this initial state, the planner can manipulate the blocks to achieve the goal 
state `(on A B) (on B C) (on-table C)` without including the goals directly in the 
initial description.
