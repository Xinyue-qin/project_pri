To solve this problem, we need to understand the current setup and what actions are needed to achieve the goal:

1. Current blocks arrangement:
   - B is on A
   - D is on C
   - B is clear (no block above it)
   - D is clear (no block above it)

2. Goal state:
   - A should be on B
   - B should be on C
   - C should be on D
   - D should be on the table

For this to happen, all blocks need to be free from constraints that prevent them from being moved into their final positions.

We need an initial state where:
- All blocks are accessible (i.e., clear or on-table) so they can be moved in sequence.
- The arm is empty to allow for pickups and placements.

Here's a suggested alternative initial state:

```pddl
(:init
  (arm-empty)
  (on A table)
  (clear A)
  (on B table)
  (clear B)
  (on C table)
  (clear C)
  (on D table)
  (clear D)
)
```

With this setup:
- All blocks are on the table and clear.
- The arm is empty.

This allows the planner to pick up and stack each block in the desired order.
